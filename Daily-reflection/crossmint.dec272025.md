## Follow-up Plan

### Message to Angela (Send by Dec 28)

```
Hey Angela,

Thanks again for the feedback on BlockRun — you were right
that the messaging wasn't clear enough.

I've been thinking about how to simplify it:

"BlockRun lets AI agents pay for AI inference with USDC.
One line of code, no API keys needed."

Would love to get your thoughts on this framing. Also curious
if there's any overlap with what Crossmint is building —
maybe there's a way to collaborate?

Happy to jump on a quick call if helpful.

Vicky
```
