**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
Claude can't generate images.
Claude has no real-time X data.
Claude stops when rate limited.

I built a plugin that fixes this.

One wallet. 30+ models. No API keys.

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
The problem with Claude Code:

You're coding, Claude hits a wall.
"I can't generate images."
"My knowledge has a cutoff."
"I'm rate limited."

You stop. Open 5 tabs. Manage 5 API keys.

There had to be a better way.

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**
So I gave Claude a wallet.

Now when it can't do something, it pays for it.

• Image? → Calls DALL-E ($0.05)
• Real-time X? → Calls Grok ($0.26)
• Second opinion? → Calls GPT ($0.001)
• Bulk task? → Calls DeepSeek ($0.0001)

Autonomous. No approval needed.

**Tweet 4 (Demo)**
How it works:

You: "generate a logo for my startup"

Claude: "I can't generate images. Want me to use DALL-E via BlockRun?"

You: "yes"

Done.

$1 USDC = 1,000 GPT calls or 10,000 DeepSeek calls.

**Tweet 5 (No API Keys)**
The magic: No API keys.

Instead of:
- OpenAI account
- xAI account
- DeepSeek account
- Google account
- Managing 5 billing dashboards

You fund ONE wallet with $1-5 USDC.

That's it.

## Single Tweet Version (for quick share)

I gave Claude Code a wallet.

Now it can:
✅ Generate images (DALL-E)
✅ Access real-time X data (Grok)
✅ Get second opinions (GPT)
✅ Save 90% on bulk tasks (DeepSeek)

No API keys. Just $1 USDC.
