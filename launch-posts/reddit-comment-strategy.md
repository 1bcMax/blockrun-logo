# Reddit Comment Strategy: Find Pain Point Threads & Comment

## Top 3 Pain Points to Target

### 1. Rate Limits (HOTTEST)
People are furious about Claude's rate limits. This is your #1 opportunity.

**Search terms (use on Reddit directly):**
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI rate limit`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI rate exceeded`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI usage limit`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI limit frustrated`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI alternative`

**Also check GitHub issues:**
- [Weekly Usage Limits Making Claude Subscriptions Unusable](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9424)
- [Unexpected change in Claude usage limits](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9094)

**Template comment:**
```
I hit this problem constantly. What helped me was setting up a fallback to DeepSeek when Claude throttles - it's 10x cheaper and handles most tasks fine.

I built a plugin that does this automatically: when Claude hits limits, it routes to DeepSeek or GPT. One wallet, no API keys to manage.

Open source if anyone wants to try: github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-claude-code-wallet
```

### 2. Can't Generate Images
Claude literally can't do this. Every time someone asks "can Claude make images?" is your opportunity.

**Search terms:**
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI generate image`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI create image`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI image generation`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI DALL-E`
- `subreddit:ClaudeAI wish could make images`

**Also check:**
- [Medium article: Nano Banana Hack](https://medium.com/coding-nexus/claude-cant-generate-images-actually-it-can-meet-the-nano-banana-pro-hack-47a6aa8b357e)

**Template comment:**
```
Claude can't generate images natively, but you can route to DALL-E or Nano Banana automatically.

I built a plugin for this - when you ask Claude Code to "generate an image," it routes to DALL-E, pays $0.05, and returns the result. No API keys needed.

### 3. Multiple API Keys Hassle
Devs hate managing 5 different AI accounts.

**Search terms:**
- `subreddit:LocalLLaMA multiple API keys`
- `subreddit:LocalLLaMA manage APIs`
- `subreddit:programming AI API keys`
- `subreddit:webdev OpenAI Claude together`

**Template comment:**
```
I had the same problem - OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Google. Five accounts, five billing dashboards, five sets of credentials.

Built a solution: one wallet, all models. Fund it with $1-5 USDC, call any model. Claude pays per-request automatically.
