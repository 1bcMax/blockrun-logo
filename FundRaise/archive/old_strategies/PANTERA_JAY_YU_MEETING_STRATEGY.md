# Pantera Capital / Jay Yu Meeting Strategy

**Meeting Date:** January 16, 2026
**Context:** Met Jay in person in SF on Jan 3; he wrote detailed thread analyzing your x402 research report
**Status:** WARM - Strong intellectual connection established

---

## TL;DR

Jay Yu is a Jr Partner at Pantera focused on research & investments. His thesis explicitly includes **stablecoin rails, AI agents, and x402**. Pantera's 2026 predictions literally mention "AI agents leveraging x402 endpoints." He's deeply informed on your space from analyzing your report.

**Key angle:** BlockRun = the trust infrastructure that makes x402 production-ready. This fills the gap Jay identified in his thread ("what happens when agents pay wrong?").

## Jay Yu Profile

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | Jr Partner, Research & Investments @ Pantera Capital |
| **Twitter** | [@0xfishylosopher](https://x.com/0xfishylosopher) |
| **Email** | jay@panteracapital.com |
| **Background** | Stanford BS CS + BA Philosophy, ex-President Stanford Blockchain Club |
| **Joined Pantera** | Jan 2025 |

### His Investment Focus Areas (From His Own Words)

1. **Bottom-up mechanism innovations** - futarchy-based governance, novel perps platforms, AI-managed DeFi vaults
2. **Frontier technologies** - TEEs, ZKPs, MPC, FHE
3. **Institutional adoption** - stablecoin rails, RWAs
4. **AI + Crypto intersection** - explicitly mentions AI agents, trading AI, LLM-driven systems

### What He Said About Your Report

Jay's key observations from his thread:

1. **Use cases**: Digital-native resources (APIs, AI inference) are easier entry points than ecommerce - agrees this limits initial TAM but sees ecommerce as the bigger opportunity

2. **Micropayments reality**: 70% transactions in $0.01-$0.10 range, not sub-cent - gas costs (~0.5-1c) create a floor

3. **Base vs Solana dynamics**:
   - Supply: 55% Base, 35% Solana
   - Demand (tx count): 70-30 Base-Solana
   - Demand (TVL): 20-80 Base-Solana (Solana wins volume)

4. **His hypothesis**: Solana wins for bot-native, high-frequency sub-cent workflows; Base wins for larger "real world economy" ecommerce transactions

5. **Future prediction**: Both chains will be market leaders in different niches

## Pantera Investment Thesis - Why BlockRun Fits

### Their 2026 Predictions (Jay's Research)

| Prediction | BlockRun Relevance |
|------------|-------------------|
| "AI agents leveraging x402 endpoints" | **They explicitly mention x402!** |
| "AI as the Encryption Interface Layer" | BlockRun is the trust/routing layer for AI payments |
| Capital-efficient consumer credit | Trust scoring enables better risk assessment |
| Stablecoin rails for institutional adoption | BlockRun uses USDC exclusively |

### Their Investment Stats

| Stage | # Investments | Avg Round Size |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Seed** | 82 | $9.6M |
| Series A | 75 | $19.9M |
| Series B | 16 | $29.7M |

**2024**: 22 investments | **2025**: 31 investments (and counting)

### Key Portfolio Companies (Relevant to BlockRun)

| Company | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| **Circle** | Pantera investor - your former employer |
| **Coinbase** | Pantera investor - x402 creator, AgentKit partner |
| **Bitso** | Stablecoin payments infrastructure |
| **Ondo** | RWA tokenization |

**Critical insight**: Pantera is already invested in both Circle AND Coinbase. BlockRun sits at the intersection of both ecosystems.

## Pitch Strategy

### Opening Frame

Don't pitch cold - build on the connection:

> "Great meeting you yesterday. Your thread captured the ecosystem dynamics really well - especially the Base vs Solana split. The piece you identified about 'what happens when agents pay wrong' is exactly what we're solving at BlockRun."

### Three Key Messages

**1. Trust Infrastructure Gap (His Own Observation)**

Jay implicitly identified the problem in his thread. Connect to it:

> "You noted x402 is exciting for micropayments but it's 'not as micro as people think' because of gas economics. The deeper issue is that 40-50% of current activity shows signs of gaming/manipulation. Before we can scale to sub-cent economics, we need trust infrastructure to separate signal from noise."

**2. Stablecoin Rails Thesis (Pantera's Core Bet)**

Pantera is deeply invested in stablecoin infrastructure:

> "Every BlockRun transaction is in USDC. We're not trying to create a new token - we're building the trust layer that makes existing stablecoin rails work for autonomous agents. This is the 'institutional adoption via stablecoin rails' thesis you've written about."

**3. First Mover in a Pantera-Tracked Space**

> "Pantera's 2026 predictions explicitly mention 'AI agents leveraging x402 endpoints.' We're the first production trust infrastructure for that ecosystem. 700+ services indexed, fraud detection live, routing API launching Q1."

### Objection Handling

| Likely Question | Response |
|----------------|----------|
| "Why not wait for the space to mature?" | "Trust is built through track record. Every month of accurate ratings compounds our credibility moat. A 2027 entrant has a pitch deck; we'll have 18 months of verified accuracy." |
| "Is this a VC-scale opportunity?" | "The trust layer for payments is always high-margin infrastructure. Visa's fraud/trust systems are a profit center, not a cost center. We take 5% of routed volume." |
| "Solana vs Base - which do you focus on?" | "Your analysis is right - different chains for different use cases. We're chain-agnostic by design. Currently more activity on Base (your data shows 55% supply), but we're building for multi-chain from day one." |
| "What's the competition?" | "Payment processors (Coinbase, PayAI) won't rate competitors - they need to stay neutral. That's our structural advantage. We're the independent rating layer that sits on top." |

## What to Ask For

### Primary Ask: Jay's Personal Angel Check

Pantera's fund is too early for your $500K angel round (their seed avg is $9.6M). But Jay personally may have angel budget.

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Ask | "Would you personally be interested in the angel round?" |
| Check Size | $10K-$25K (typical for Jr Partner personal investment) |
| Why It Works | Low commitment, relationship builder, signal value |

**How to frame it:**

> "我们现在在 close 一个小的 angel round — 主要是 Circle 和 Coinbase 生态的人。Pantera 的 fund 对这个 size 可能太早，但如果你个人有兴趣参与，我们很欢迎。"

> "We're closing a small angel round — mostly people from the Circle and Coinbase ecosystem. This is probably too early for Pantera's fund, but if you're personally interested in participating, we'd love to have you."

### Secondary Ask: Seed Round Relationship

Position for Pantera's institutional check in Q2/Q3 2026:

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Round Size | $3-5M Seed |
| Pantera Check | $1-2M lead or co-lead |
| Timing | Q2-Q3 2026 |

> "真正的 institutional round 是 Q2/Q3 的 Seed。到时候 metrics 会更 solid — 100K+ daily transactions, $50K+ MRR。希望到时候能和 Pantera 正式聊。"

### Tertiary Ask: Portfolio Introductions

Pantera's portfolio includes companies that could be BlockRun customers/partners:

- Circle (former employer - already connected)
- Coinbase (AgentKit integration)
- Bitso (LatAm stablecoin payments)
- Any AI-adjacent portfolio companies

### Bonus Ask: Research Collaboration

Jay is research-focused. Offer:

> "Would love to co-author follow-up research on x402 ecosystem evolution. You have the distribution; we have the data pipeline."

- First mover advantage in Pantera-tracked space

### Phase 5: The Ask (5 min)

**Frame it casually:**

> "我们现在 close 一个小的 angel round，$500K，主要是 Circle/Coinbase 生态的人。这个 size 对 Pantera fund 肯定太早 — 但如果你个人有兴趣，很欢迎你加入。"

> "真正的 institutional round 是 Q2/Q3 的 Seed，$3-5M。到时候 metrics 会更 solid。希望那时候能正式和 Pantera 聊。"

**What you're actually asking for:**
1. His personal angel check ($10-25K)

## Why This Meeting Matters

1. **Pantera explicitly tracks x402** - Their 2026 predictions mention it by name
2. **Jay just analyzed your data** - Deep intellectual engagement
3. **In-person connection** - Warmest possible intro
4. **Portfolio synergy** - Circle + Coinbase investors
5. **Two-stage opportunity** - Personal angel now, Pantera fund for Seed

### Strategic Value of Jay's Personal Check

Even a small $10-25K personal check from Jay is valuable because:

| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Signal** | "Pantera's research lead invested personally" |
| **Internal champion** | He'll track your progress for Seed round |
| **Network access** | Opens doors to other Pantera portfolio companies |
| **Research collaboration** | Future x402 reports with Pantera distribution |

This is one of the best-fit institutional investors for BlockRun's **Seed round**. The Jan 16 meeting plants the seed (pun intended).
