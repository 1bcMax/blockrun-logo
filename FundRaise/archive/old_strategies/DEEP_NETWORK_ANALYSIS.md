## TIER 0: DEEPEST RELATIONSHIPS (10+ Years)

**These are your TRUE friends & family - longest LinkedIn connections**

| Name | Current Role | Connected Since | Years | Priority | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Diana Hu** | YC General Partner | Feb 2012 | **13 years** | **HIGHEST** | YC GP, can provide credibility + intros |
| **Tong Li** | IDG Capital Advisor | Feb 2012 | **13 years** | **HIGHEST** | Major VC network in Asia |
| **Nathan Z** | Trust Wallet VP of Products | Mar 2012 | **13 years** | **HIGHEST** | Deep crypto native, Binance ecosystem |
| **Steve Englander** | Decentralize Labs Founder | Jan 2012 | **13 years** | **HIGH** | Crypto founder, could angel invest |
| **Yun Fu** | Otter.ai CTO & Co-Founder | Aug 2012 | **12 years** | **HIGH** | AI founder, can angel invest + advise |
| **Hans Sayyadi** | Dropbox Dir AI/ML - GenAI Agents | Feb 2013 | **12 years** | **HIGH** | AI Agents expert! Perfect domain fit |
| **Chi-Yi Kuan** | Nextdoor Head of Data Science | Apr 2013 | **11 years** | **HIGH** | Data science leader, could angel invest |

### Why Tier 0 Matters

These are people who've known you for 10+ years. In a friends & family round, relationship depth > title. A $10K check from Diana Hu (YC GP, 13-year connection) has more signal value than $50K from a new VC.

**Suggested Ask for Tier 0:** Personal outreach, reference your long history, ask for $10K-25K checks or warm intros.
