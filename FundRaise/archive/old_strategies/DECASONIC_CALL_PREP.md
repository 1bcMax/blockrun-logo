### Follow-Up Templates

**Wednesday (if no response):**
> "Hi Abdul, hope you had a good weekend. Just wanted to check in - happy to answer any follow-up questions or provide additional materials. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."

**Friday (if still nothing):**
> "Want to make sure I'm not leaving you hanging - is this something Decasonic wants to explore further, or should I focus elsewhere?"

---

## Key Intel: This Is a Warm Lead

**Abdul Al Ali**, the person you quoted in your pitch deck, is **on the Decasonic investment team**. He wrote the x402 Market Map. You're speaking directly to someone who has already publicly identified the exact problem you're solving.

**You've pre-sent:** Pitch deck + State of x402 analysis. He has context. This is a conversation, not a presentation.

**Personal Connection:** You met Paul Hsu at the Santosh roundtable in Dubai last year. Use this as warm-up context if appropriate.

---

## Your Core Pitch: Partner to Help Sell

**You don't need money. You need a distribution partner.**

> "I can build this product alone - it's already live, I have PRs merged to Coinbase. What I'm missing is distribution. You know everyone in the x402 ecosystem. Abdul, you wrote the Market Map - you know all 115 projects better than anyone. I want a partner who helps me sell, not one who sits back and waits for returns."

**Why this works:**
- You're not a needy founder begging for money to survive
- You know exactly what help you need
- You treat them as a partner, not an ATM
- This is their thesis - "co-build", "enhancement capital"

---

## Your Target: AI + Crypto Community

**This perfectly matches Decasonic's thesis.**

Paul Hsu said:
> "The convergence of AI x crypto is foundational. AI agents, RWA tokenization, and DePIN are reshaping what scalable utility looks like."

| Community | Why You Target Them | Size |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| **AI Agent builders** | They need payments, you provide trust layer | AgentKit 10K devs, GOAT SDK 150K downloads |
| **x402 ecosystem** | 115 projects need verification + discovery | Abdul's Market Map |
| **Crypto-native AI projects** | Pay for AI services with USDC | Growing fast |

**How to say it:**
> "I'm targeting the AI + Crypto community - that's exactly your thesis. Many of your portfolio companies are my target users. Your intros are 10x faster than my cold outreach."

---

## The Ask

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Raise** | $300K |
| **Valuation** | $10M - $15M |
| **Ownership** | 2% - 3% |

Your deck says $300K-500K. Frame it as:
> "The deck shows $300-500K - that's the full round. For Decasonic, I'm thinking $300K at $10-15M. I care more about having the right partners who help me sell than maximizing the check."

---

## Use of Funds: $300K / 18 Months

| Category | Amount | What It Covers |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Infrastructure** | $50K | Cloud, APIs, multi-chain deployment, monitoring |
| **GTM & Partnerships** | $100K | Conferences, integration bounties, co-marketing, developer evangelism |
| **Testing & R&D** | $40K | Mainnet transactions, x402 service testing, integration QA, gas fees |
| **Operations** | $60K | Legal, accounting, compliance, security audits, design |
| **Buffer** | $50K | 18-month cushion |

**Burn:** ~$15K/month | **Runway:** 18-20 months

---

## 30-Minute Structure (Materials Pre-Sent)

**Don't walk through the deck. He's read it. Be conversational.**

| Time | Focus | What to Do |
|------|-------|------------|
| **0-3 min** | Warm-up | Let him lead. Small talk. He'll reference what he read. |
| **3-10 min** | His questions | Answer what HE wants to know. Go deep where he's curious. |
| **10-15 min** | Demo or deep-dive | If he hasn't seen BlockRun live, offer to show it. Otherwise, go deeper on data moat. |
| **15-22 min** | His perspective + Your ask | Ask HIM questions. Then: "I want partners who help me sell, not just money." |
| **22-27 min** | The deal | $300K at $10-15M, milestones, what you'll do with it |
| **27-30 min** | Next steps | "What does your process look like?" |

**Target:** 50/50 talk time. Don't monologue.

## Why Decasonic (What You Want From Them)

| Resource | How It Helps You Sell |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Portfolio network** | 28 portfolio companies = potential customers/partners in AI + Crypto |
| **Co-investor network** | Outlier, Blockchange, Shima - their portfolios are your leads |
| **x402 ecosystem connections** | Abdul knows all 115 projects in his Market Map |
| **Coinbase relationship** | They invest in Web3, they know Coinbase people |
| **Decasonic Labs** | Allister Lam (21yr Google) can help with technical co-building |
| **Token design expertise** | Danny Pantuso - for when you're ready for token |
| **Events** | Web3 Investor Day - present to AI + Crypto investors, find customers |

**How to say it:**
> "Your portfolio has 28 companies, your co-investor network is even bigger. Every intro is a potential customer or partner. That's 10x faster than my cold outreach. And they're all in AI + Crypto - exactly my target community."

---

## Paul Hsu's Investment Philosophy

| Topic | What He Believes |
|-------|------------------|
| **On Founders** | "Outlier founders have a winner mindset, a do-or-die hustle & a conviction in their vision" |
| **On Growth** | "Grants are not a growth strategy. Founders chasing capital over users burn out before they break out." |
| **On Their Role** | "We don't just invest, we co-build alongside the frontier." = "enhancement capital" |
| **On Product** | They "accelerate product market fit and systematically scale start-ups" |
| **On Market** | "Blockchain today is equivalent to the Internet in 1998." |
| **On AI x Crypto** | "The convergence of AI x crypto is foundational. AI agents, RWA tokenization, and DePIN are reshaping what scalable utility looks like." |
| **On Returns** | "100x+ outcomes" - they want big upside potential |

---

## They Want 100x - How to Address

**Their expectation:** "On a relentless pursuit to partner with outlier founders who generate 100x+ outcomes."

**Your honest pitch:**

> "My base case is profitability plus a $50-100M exit - acquired by Circle or Coinbase. That doesn't require x402 to become a trillion dollar market. But if x402 really wins - and you and Coinbase are both betting on this - then it's a $1B+ opportunity. I won't promise 100x, but the upside is there. The downside is I have a profitable business."

**The math:**

| x402 Scenario | Daily Txns | Your Revenue | Company Value |
|---------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Moderate success | 1M-10M | $5K-$50K/day | $50-200M |
| Becomes THE standard | 100M+ | $500K+/day | $1B+ |

**Key framing:**
> "The effort to build a big business is the same as building a small one. I want to build big. With you helping me distribute, the odds are better."

---

## Solo Founder + AI Framing

**Why 1 person works:**

> "I'm staying lean intentionally. AI writes the code - I built the entire product with Claude and Cursor. The $300K isn't for hiring engineers. It's for GTM acceleration: partnerships, infrastructure, getting to revenue faster. At $50K MRR, I'll raise a seed. Until then, I'm the most capital-efficient bet you can find."

**If he asks "Why no team?":**

> "The best way to prove AI can replace engineering teams is to be the proof. I'm a one-person company with a live product, PRs merged to Coinbase, and partnerships with AgentKit and GOAT SDK. If I hired 5 engineers, I'd just be another startup. This way, I'm the case study."

**If he asks "What if you get sick?":**

> "The product is live and self-running. The codebase is clean because AI wrote it - any competent developer can pick it up. But realistically, if I'm out, the company pauses. That's the trade-off for capital efficiency at this stage. At seed, I'll have redundancy."

---

## Exit Strategy: Two Paths

### Path 1: Token Launch (More Likely for Decasonic)

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Now** | Equity raise, $300K at $10-15M |
| **2026** | Build traction, $50K MRR |
| **2027** | Launch $BLOCKRUN token |
| **Token utility** | Trust staking, fee payments, rating rewards |
| **Investor exit** | Token warrant converts, they sell on market |

**How to say it:**
> "Token is a natural fit - trust staking, rating rewards, fee payments. But I'm focused on PMF and traction right now. Token design comes after PMF, probably 2027. I know Decasonic has token design expertise - that's one reason I want to work with you."

### Path 2: Acquisition (Backup)

| Acquirer | Why | Valuation |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Circle | Stablecoin infrastructure, you know them | $50-150M |
| Coinbase | Own the trust layer for x402 | $50-200M |
| Stripe | Crypto payments play | $100M+ |

**How to say it:**
> "There are two exit paths. Token is one - a faster liquidity event. Acquisition is another - Circle and Coinbase are both natural acquirers. You invest in Web3, you definitely know people there. When the time comes, your intro is stronger than me knocking on doors myself."

---

## Questions He May Ask

### "Why you?"
> "I spent three years at Circle building the data layer behind USDC. Before that, I built anti-fraud AI at Capital One. This is the exact intersection of my entire career - trust infrastructure for payments."

### "What's your moat?"
> "We're already collecting data on every x402 service - uptime, response times, transaction patterns. Every day that passes, our data advantage grows. Someone starting in 2027 can raise more money than me - but they can't buy 18 months of data."

### "Isn't Coinbase building Bazaar for discovery?"
> "Coinbase Bazaar is a directory. We're building trust - reputation ratings, verified accuracy, fraud detection. They list services. We tell you which ones are reliable."

### "Why now?"
> "x402 V2 launched December 11, 2025. You documented 500K payments in one week in October. Adoption is happening now. Being early to the trust layer is the whole opportunity."

### "What about Yala?"
> "I was at Yala working on their stablecoin protocol. Great team, good traction. But I saw institutional players entering DeFi/stablecoin - Circle, Tether, now PayPal. The opportunity for a smaller player to win that market is shrinking. AI agents are the opposite - early, fragmented, perfect for builders who move fast. That's why I went all-in on BlockRun."

**If he pushes on the transition:**
> "I left on good terms. Finished my transition cleanly with the CEO. BlockRun needed full focus - I couldn't do both."

### "What are the risks?"
Be honest:
- x402 adoption pace
- Regulatory clarity on stablecoin payments

> "But that's why timing matters, and why I want partners who already understand the thesis."

### "How big can this get?"
> "Base case is a $50-100M exit. If x402 becomes the standard for AI payments, that's a $1B+ opportunity. I won't promise 100x, but the upside is there. The effort to build big is the same as building small - I want to build big. With you helping me distribute, the odds are better."

## Questions to Ask Him

1. **"What's your reaction to the trust layer thesis?"** - Tests if he agrees
2. **"Of your 28 portfolio companies, who might be a customer or partner for me?"** - Shows you want their network
3. **"Are you seeing other startups tackling trust/discovery?"** - Competitive intel
4. **"How does Decasonic Labs specifically co-build with portfolio founders?"** - Understand their value add
5. **"What made Assisterr compelling as a pre-seed AI infrastructure bet?"** - Understand their criteria
6. **"What would make this a clear yes for you?"** - Surfaces objections
