**The Trust Layer for AI Payments**

---

## 1. The Shift

> "A verification layer would be necessary for continued adoption."
>
> "A layer for discoverability remains missing."
>
> — **Abdul Al Ali, The x402 Market Map, Oct 2025**

Payments are irreversible. No refunds. No chargebacks.

**You identified the gaps. I'm building the solution.**

---

## 2. The Problem

How does an AI know which service to trust before paying?

Right now, it doesn't.

- No idea which one to use
- No refunds
- No chargebacks
- No customer service

**Once an agent pays, the payment is final.**

## 3. BlockRun

**Phase 1 (LIVE - Jan 2, 2026):** AI Gateway
- 31 LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Pay-per-use with USDC, no API keys
- One line of code. Wallet = identity.
- Currently onboarding users

**Phase 2 (2026):** Trust Layer for All x402
- Reputation ratings for 700+ services
- Discovery across 618+ indexed services
- Verification: uptime, response times, fraud detection

Start with AI. Expand to everything.

## 4. Why This Works

**AI Gateway** = wedge (proves we deliver)
**Trust Routing** = the business (where we scale)

| Daily Transactions | MRR |
|-------------------|-----|
| 10K | $1.5K |
| 1M | $150K |
| 100M | $15M |

*Based on $0.10 avg transaction, 5% Trust Routing fee*


---

## 5. Traction

| What | Status |
|------|--------|
| AI Gateway | **LIVE** on Base mainnet (Jan 2, 2026) |
| User onboarding | **Active** |
| Coinbase x402 team | PR merged, feature requests open |
| PayAI partnership | Data sharing, joint research |
| Discovery data | Collecting all facilitator transactions daily |
| State of x402 report | Published with viral traction |
| Solana | On roadmap (user-requested) |

Not just building on x402. Building with the core team.

---

## 6. Why Me

**Circle** — Head of Data Science, built USDC data infrastructure

**Capital One** — Director of Data Science, anti-fraud AI

**Microsoft** — Azure ML Tech Lead

I've built trust infrastructure for payments before. I'm building it again.

## 7. GotoMarket & Distribution

| Channel | Reach |
|---------|-------|
| Coinbase AgentKit | 10K+ agent devs |
| GOAT SDK | 150K downloads |
| Polymarket Agents | Integrated |

10 more Partner integration  on the roadmap
Every integration = distribution.

---

## 8. Why Now

x402 V2 launched December 11, 2025.
BlockRun launched January 2, 2026.

**Our Moat:** Already collecting discovery data across all x402 services. Every day we run, the data advantage grows.

A competitor starting mid-2026 won't have our head start.

They'll have a pitch deck.

---

## 9. The Ask

**$300K-500K Angel Round**

For acceleration and the right partners.

**Milestones This Unlocks:**
| Timeline | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Q1 2026 | 10+ Partnership integrations, $1K MRR |
| Q2 2026 | Trust Ratings beta, $10K MRR |
| Q3 2026 | Solana support (user-requested) |
| Q4 2026 | Multi-chain live, $50K MRR, Seed-ready |

**Key Risks:** x402 adoption pace, regulatory clarity on stablecoin payments

The right partners accelerate everything.

---

## 10. BlockRun

The trust layer the ecosystem needs.

You identified the gap. We're filling it.

**I'm choosing partners who get it.**
