## PRIMARY TARGET: SEAN NEVILLE

### Profile

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Name** | Sean Neville |
| **LinkedIn** | linkedin.com/in/seanneville |

| **Previous** | **Co-Founder, Circle** (co-invented USDC) |
| **Circle Role** | Board Director (still) |
| **Connected Since** | August 2021 (4+ years) |

### Why Sean is THE Perfect Investor

**1. Catena Labs = AI Agents + Finance**
> "AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions, but today's financial systems are unprepared... That's why we're building an AI-native financial institution."
> — Sean Neville, May 2025

**BlockRun + Catena = Perfect Synergy:**
- Catena: Banking/financial services for AI agents

- **Together:** Complete financial stack for autonomous agents

**2. He Raised $18M from Top Investors**

- Breyer Capital
- Coinbase Ventures (likely)

If Sean invests in BlockRun, these investors see it. Potential intro path to a16z crypto for future rounds.

- Still on Circle board
- Understands the USDC ecosystem better than anyone
- Can validate Circle acquisition thesis

**4. Personal Relationship**

### Approach for Sean (Casual, Personal)

**Don't:** Formal pitch deck, VC-style presentation

**Do:** Personal conversation, peer-to-peer, "catching up"

**Message Template:**
```
Subject: Quick catch up - building something you'll find interesting

Hey Sean,

Hope you're doing well! Congrats on Catena Labs coming out of
stealth - the AI-native bank thesis is exactly right.

Since leaving Circle, I've been building something complementary:
BlockRun is an x402 AI gateway that lets agents pay for AI inference
with USDC micropayments. Every transaction is in USDC on Base.

We just launched private beta (Dec 25) and doing a small friends &
family round before public launch in January.

Given what you're building with Catena, I think there's real synergy.
Would love to catch up and share what we're doing. Do you have
30 mins next week?

Vicky
```

**Key Framing:**
- Peer-to-peer (you both left Circle to build AI agent infra)
- Synergy angle (BlockRun + Catena complement each other)
- Friends & family (not a formal pitch)
- USDC angle (his baby - every BlockRun payment is USDC)

---

### What to Discuss with Sean

**1. Synergy Conversation**
> "I saw Catena is building financial infrastructure for AI agents.
> BlockRun is the payment layer for agents to access AI. We're
> solving different parts of the same problem."

**2. USDC Utility**
> "Every BlockRun transaction is in USDC. This is the killer app
> USDC needs - machine-to-machine micropayments at scale."

**3. x402 Protocol**
> "We're the first production x402 V2 deployment. Coinbase and
> Cloudflare are backing the protocol. It's early but promising."

**4. The Ask (Casual)**
> "I'm doing a small friends & family round - $500K at $16M.
> Would love to have you involved, even if it's a small check.
> Your signal value is worth more than the capital."

**Suggested Check Size:** $25K - $100K (whatever feels right for him)

---

### Potential Partnership Discussion

Beyond investment, explore:

| Opportunity | Idea |
|-------------|------|
| **Technical Integration** | Catena agents use BlockRun for AI access |
| **Co-marketing** | Joint announcement on AI agent infrastructure |
| **Investor Intros** | Intro to a16z crypto, Breyer for future rounds |
| **Advisory** | Sean as informal advisor |

## BILL QIAN - Friends & Family Framing

You connected with Bill in June 2025 (6 months ago). For a friends & family round, adjust the tone:

### Casual Approach (Not VC Pitch)

**Don't:**
- Formal deck presentation
- VC-style pitch with TAM/SAM
- Aggressive valuation negotiation

**Do:**
- Personal conversation
- "I'm building something interesting"
- "Wanted to share with people I respect in the space"

### Revised Opener for Bill
```
"Bill, thanks for taking the time. I wanted to share what I've been
building since leaving Circle. It's early days, and I'm doing a
small friends & family round with people who understand the space.
Given your background and what Cypher has done in AI + crypto,
I thought you'd appreciate the vision."
```

### Bill's Unique Value
- Binance Labs network
- MENA expansion potential
- Crypto-native credibility
- Portfolio synergies (CARV, Aethir)

### Ask for Bill (Casual)
> "I'm raising $500K-$1M from friends and people who get the space.
> Not looking for a formal fund investment right now - just angels
> who want to be part of the journey early. Would you be interested
> in participating personally?"
