## CIRCLE Priority #1: Sean Neville (Circle Co-Founder → Catena Labs)

### Profile Summary
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Sean Neville |
| **Current Role** | Co-Founder & CEO |
| **Company** | Catena Labs |
| **Previous** | Co-Founder, Circle (invented USDC!) |
| **LinkedIn** | https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanneville |
| **Location** | Boston, Massachusetts |

### Background
- **Co-founded Circle Internet Group** with Jeremy Allaire
- **Invented USDC** - the stablecoin BlockRun uses for all payments
- **Now building Catena Labs** - "First AI-native financial institution"
- **May 2025:** Catena Labs raised **$18M seed** from a16z crypto, Breyer Capital, Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, CoinFund, Pillar VC
- **Notable angel investors:** Tom Brady, Balaji Srinivasan, Bradley Horowitz

### Catena Labs Vision
> "AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions, but today's financial systems are unprepared and resistant to interactions with automated intelligence."

- Building AI-native FI for agentic commerce
- Released **Agent Commerce Kit (ACK)** - protocols for AI agent identity and payments
- Focus: Agent identity, trust, and payments on open W3C Web Standards

### Why Sean Neville is the #1 PRIORITY for BlockRun

| Factor | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| **INVENTED USDC** | BlockRun uses USDC for ALL payments - Sean created this! |
| **Building same thesis** | Catena Labs and BlockRun both focus on AI agent payments |
| **Circle co-founder** | Vicky's former ultimate boss - knows Circle Data Science team |
| **$18M raised** | Has capital and could angel invest or make strategic intro |
| **Direct competitor/partner?** | Catena Labs' ACK could integrate with BlockRun |
| **Network** | Access to a16z crypto, Coinbase Ventures, Tom Brady, Balaji |

### Potential Concerns
- Catena Labs might see BlockRun as a competitor (ACK vs BlockRun Trust API)
- May want to acquire rather than invest - evaluate terms carefully
- Very senior, may be hard to get time

### Recommended Pitch Angle
> "I spent 3 years leading Data Science at Circle - the company you co-founded. Now I'm building BlockRun - trust infrastructure for the x402 AI agent payment ecosystem. Catena Labs and BlockRun have complementary visions. Our Trust + Routing API could integrate with ACK to solve the trust problem you've identified. Let's talk about partnership or investment."

### Action Items for Sean Neville

- [x] **Email sent** (January 6, 2026) ✅
  ```
  Hi Sean,

  Happy New Year! Thanks for reaching out. :)

  Quick context: I've been building on x402 on Base. Recently published
  the State of x402 2025 [paper] [deck] which got good traction.

  What's live:
  - Permissionless LLM access using USDC on Base (any agent can pay for
    GPT-4/Claude/etc) [Demo]
  - Autonomous Polymarket trading agent (manages own wallet, uses LLMs,
    places real trades)
  - Building a trust layer from onchain agent payment transaction data

  I've been following Catena's work on ACK-ID and ACK-Pay. Would love
  to explore how to partner.

  I'll be traveling next Wednesday morning, but otherwise open to a call
  anytime next week that works for you.

  Best,
  Vicky
  ```

- [x] **Research Catena Labs ACK** - Deep analysis completed (see `/Users/vickyfu/Documents/blockrunGTM/Research/Catena_Labs_Deep_Analysis.md`)

    - Strategic investment ($50K-100K)
    - Catena Labs partnership/integration
    - Intro to Catena Labs investors (a16z, Coinbase Ventures)

  Hi Rohan,

  Your posts about AI and crypto convergence really resonate - "merging faster
  than we think" is exactly what I'm seeing. I'm building the infrastructure
  for this convergence.

  I'm Vicky, former Head of Data Science at Circle. BlockRun is the trust
  layer for AI agent payments - pay-per-use access to 31+ frontier LLMs
  via USDC micropayments, plus trust scoring for 700+ services in the x402
  ecosystem.

  The market is real: 100M+ transactions, $600M+ volume in 2025. AI agents
  are 46% of x402 services.

  Given your focus on AI + Consumer investments, I'd love your perspective.
  We're doing a small angel round. Would you have 20 mins to chat?

  Best,
  Vicky
