**The Credit Score for Machines**

---

## 1. The Belief

I believe AI agents will conduct most economic transactions within 5 years.

Not "might." **Will.**

And when they do, they'll need someone to tell them who to trust.

That's what I'm building.

---

## 2. The Crazy Part

Imagine telling someone in 2010:

> "In 15 years, software will have its own money and spend it without asking humans."

They'd call you crazy.

**That future arrived December 11, 2025** — when Coinbase and Cloudflare launched x402.

Now AI agents can pay for things. Automatically. Irreversibly.

**The question isn't IF this happens. It's WHO builds the trust layer.**

---

## 3. Why This Seems Impossible

- "AI agents spending money? That's sci-fi."
- "Crypto payments? That's a niche."
- "Trust ratings for machines? Who needs that?"

**My family doesn't get it. Most VCs don't get it.**

But I spent 3 years at Circle watching USDC go from "that's crazy" to moving $50B+ daily.

I know what "crazy" looks like before it becomes obvious.

---

## 4. The Insight

Every payment system in history needed trust infrastructure:

- **1950s:** Credit scores for humans
- **1990s:** SSL certificates for websites
- **2010s:** Verified badges for social media
- **2025:** Trust ratings for AI agents

**Machines are the new economic actors. They need their own trust layer.**

I've built trust infrastructure for payments before (Circle, Capital One). I'm building it again.

## 5. What We're Building

**Phase 1 (LIVE):** AI Gateway
- 31 LLM models, pay-per-use with USDC
- First production x402 deployment
- Proves we deliver what we promise

**Phase 2 (2026):** Trust Layer
- Reputation ratings for 700+ services
- Fraud detection, uptime monitoring
- The Yelp for machines

**Phase 3 (2027+):** The Credit Bureau for AI
- Agent identity and reputation
- Credit scores for machines
- Financial services for autonomous entities

---

## 6. The Moat That Grows Daily

x402 V2 launched: **December 11, 2025**
BlockRun launched: **December 25, 2025**

We're already collecting transaction data across every x402 service. Every day:
- More uptime data
- More response time data
- More fraud patterns

**A competitor starting in 2027 can raise more money than me.**

**They can't buy 18 months of data.**

---

## 7. Why Me

**Circle** — Head of Data Science. Built the data layer behind USDC.

**Capital One** — Director of Data Science. Built anti-fraud AI.

**Microsoft** — Azure ML Tech Lead.

I've been at the intersection of trust, payments, and AI my entire career.

When x402 launched, I didn't see a business opportunity.

**I saw something I was born to build.**

## 8. The Math (If You Care)

| Daily Transactions | MRR |
|-------------------|-----|
| 10K | $1.5K |
| 1M | $150K |
| 100M | $15M |

5% fee on trust-routed transactions. $0.10 average transaction.

**But honestly? The math isn't the point.**

The point is: if AI agents become major economic actors, whoever owns the trust layer owns critical infrastructure.

---

## 9. The Ask

**$500K**

To be the first institutional partner in the trust layer for AI payments.

| When | What |
|------|------|
| Q1 2026 | 10+ integrations, product-market fit signals |
| Q2 2026 | Trust Ratings beta, first paying customers |
| Q4 2026 | Multi-chain, $50K MRR, Seed-ready |

---

## 10. Why Boost VC

You were early to Coinbase when Bitcoin was "crazy."

You invest $500K to be the first partner in important things.

**AI agents spending money sounds crazy today.**

It won't sound crazy in 2027.

**I'm looking for partners who see the future before it's obvious.**

---

## The Quest

The autonomous economy is coming.

Machines will transact trillions.

Someone needs to build the trust infrastructure.

**That's my quest.**

Dare mighty things.
