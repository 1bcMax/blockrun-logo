# How to Present to Ren - Format Guide

**Meeting Type**: Follow-up conversation with existing relationship
**Investor Profile**: Technical GP (engineer-first, not MBA investor)
**Your Goal**: Update on progress → Gauge investment interest

---

## DON'T Do a Formal Pitch Deck Presentation

❌ **Don't open with**: "Thanks for taking the time, let me walk you through my deck..."
❌ **Don't**: Present 14 slides in order
❌ **Don't**: Treat this like a first meeting

**Why**: You already know each other. Ren is technical. He wants a conversation, not a performance.

---

## DO Have a Conversation

✅ **Open with momentum** (30 seconds)
✅ **Let him drive** with questions
✅ **Have materials ready** but only show when relevant
✅ **Go deep on technical questions** - this is where you shine

---

## The Format: Three-Part Structure

### Part 1: The Update (2-3 minutes max)

**Your opening:**

"Hey Ren, thanks for making time. Quick update on where we are:

We went live on Base in January - the AI Gateway is processing real transactions with 31 models. We've got an autonomous Polymarket agent that's been trading 24/7 with real USDC - it manages its own wallet, uses our gateway for analysis, and places trades completely autonomously.

On the Coinbase side, we got our PR merged into the x402 repo and have feature requests open, so we're actively contributing to the protocol. We're also monitoring 618+ services daily and published the 'State of x402' report that got about 2,000 engagements.

We're opening up the $2M seed round now, and I wanted to see if Electric wants to participate."

**Then stop talking.** Let him respond.

---

### Part 2: The Conversation (20-40 minutes)

**He'll ask questions. Answer them. Go deep.**

#### Two modes you'll toggle between:

**Mode 1: Technical Deep Dive** (He'll probe your methodology)
- How do you detect fraud?
- What's your uptime scoring approach?
- Why can't Coinbase build this?
- What's your competitive moat?

**How to respond:**
- Be specific and technical
- Use your Circle/Capital One experience as proof points
- Show the live products (screen share if needed)
- Reference the 700+ services analysis
- **Don't bullshit** - if you don't know, say "good question, here's how we're thinking about it"

**Mode 2: Market/Business** (He'll test your thinking)
- How does this scale?
- What's the revenue model long-term?
- Who are your real competitors?
- What's the Phase 3 vision?

**How to respond:**
- Connect back to infrastructure thesis ("not an app, it's a layer")
- Show the unit economics (simple math)
- Reference Electric's portfolio companies if relevant ("similar to how [X] positioned...")
- Be honest about challenges

---

### Part 3: The Ask (Last 5 minutes)

**When the conversation winds down, make it clear:**

"So to be direct: we're raising $2M for a 24-month runway to become the default trust layer for x402. Would Electric be interested in leading or co-leading this round?"

**Or if you want to gauge interest first:**

"What would Electric need to see to participate in this round?"

**Then:**
- If interested → Schedule next steps
- If not → Ask what would change their mind
- If maybe → Ask what additional info they need

---

## What to Have Ready (But Don't Force)

### 1. **Screen Share Options** (Only if he asks or it's relevant)

**Option A: Live Product Demo**
- Show blockrun.ai AI Gateway interface
- Show the Polymarket agent running live
- GitHub repo with merged PRs

**When to use**: If he asks "show me what you built" or wants to see technical details

**Option B: Data/Metrics**
- Your 700+ services analysis dashboard
- Service reliability data you're collecting
- Transaction volume charts

**When to use**: If he asks about your methodology or data insights

**Option C: Deck (Selective Pages)**
- **Page 7**: Infrastructure stack diagram
- **Page 8**: The moat (compounding assets)
- **Page 12**: Business model unit economics
- **Page 4**: Three-phase roadmap

**When to use**: Only if specific questions come up that a slide answers better than words

### 2. **Quick Reference Notes** (For you, not to show)

Have your one-page cheat sheet printed/visible:
- Key metrics
- Questions to ask him
- Your close statement

---

## The Screen Share Strategy

### Start: No Screen Share
- Begin with just video/audio conversation
- This feels more natural and conversational

### If He Asks Technical Questions:
"Want me to pull up the product and show you?"
- Then screen share the live demo

### If He Asks About Data:
"I can show you the services analysis if helpful?"
- Then screen share your dashboard

### If He Wants Overview:
"Should I pull up a couple slides to show the stack?"
- Then screen share selective deck pages (not full presentation)

---

## Sample Flow (How This Might Actually Go)

**You:** [Opening update - 2 minutes]

**Ren:** "Tell me more about the fraud detection methodology. How are you thinking about that?"

**You:** [Technical answer about pattern analysis, reference your Capital One anti-fraud experience, mention the 700+ services baseline]

**Ren:** "Can you show me what you're seeing in the data?"

**You:** "Sure, let me pull it up." [Screen share your monitoring dashboard]

**Ren:** [Asks follow-up questions about specific edge cases]

**You:** [Go deeper, show GitHub PRs, maybe demo the live agent]

**Ren:** "What does the competitive landscape look like?"

**You:** [Infrastructure positioning, moat discussion, maybe pull up the stack diagram slide]

**Ren:** "How does this scale beyond x402?"

**You:** [Phase 3 vision - Agent Credit Bureau]

**Ren:** "Interesting. What are you raising?"

**You:** "$2M seed for 24-month runway. Would Electric want to lead or co-lead?"

**Ren:** [Response - interested/maybe/need more info]

**You:** [Next steps based on his response]

## Reading the Room

### If Ren is engaged (asking detailed questions):
✅ **Go deeper** - this is good
✅ **Show technical details** - he wants to see the work
✅ **Take your time** - depth > brevity

### If Ren seems skeptical:
✅ **Ask directly**: "What concerns you most about this?"
✅ **Address head-on** - don't dodge
✅ **Get specific feedback** on what would change his mind

### If Ren is distracted/short responses:
⚠️ **Check in**: "Is this a bad time? Happy to reschedule."
⚠️ **Get to the point faster**: Skip to the ask

### If Ren is excited (building on your ideas):
🎉 **Let him talk** - he's selling himself
🎉 **Take notes** - his ideas might be good
🎉 **Make the ask** - strike while hot

## Handling Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Why can't Coinbase just build this?"

**Good answer:**
"They're focused on the protocol layer - payment rails. They need a neutral third party for trust ratings. Same reason FICO is independent of banks. Plus, we're already collaborating with them - we have merged PRs and they're engaging with our feature requests. They see us as complementary, not competitive."

**Then show**: Your GitHub PRs in their repo

---

### Scenario 2: "What if someone forks your code and competes on price?"

**Good answer:**
"The code isn't the moat - the methodology is. We're building 18 months of historical uptime data by mid-2027. A competitor starting in Q3 2026 can see the same blockchain data, but they can't replicate 8 months of latency distributions and calibrated fraud signals. Trust infrastructure is built through track record, not code clones. It's exactly like your Codeslaw tool - the code is visible, the insight is in the analysis."

**Why this works**: References his own work (Codeslaw), shows you understand technical moats

---

### Scenario 3: "How do you know developers will integrate this?"

**Good answer:**
"We're already in conversations with Coinbase AgentKit, GOAT SDK has 150K downloads, and nofx has 10K GitHub stars. We're not selling to end users - we're shipping code to repositories. Developers discover us through their tools. Each integration is distribution to their entire developer base. That's how infrastructure scales."

**Then show**: Your partnership pipeline or integration roadmap

---

### Scenario 4: "What's your revenue model long-term?"

**Good answer:**
"Two streams: AI Gateway is 5% markup - proves we deliver and generates cash now. Trust Routing is 5% fee on routed volume - that's where we scale. At 100M monthly transactions, that's $500K-$1M MRR. Simple unit economics: $0.10 average transaction, $0.005 fee per transaction. We're capturing margin on the growth curve."

**Then show**: Page 12 of your deck with the revenue table

- Show what you've built
- Go deep on technical questions
- Be honest about challenges
- Make the ask directly

**You've already done the hard part (shipping product). Now just show him what you built.**

Good luck! 🚀
