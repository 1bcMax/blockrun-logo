**Valuation:** $16M post-money

---

## Recommended Deal Terms

### Funding Amount
| Option | Amount | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Target** | **$750K** | 12-15 months runway, hire 1-2 key people |
| Minimum | $500K | 10-12 months runway, lean team |
| Maximum | $1M | 18 months runway, faster scaling |

### Valuation

| Metric | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Post-Money Valuation** | **$16M** |
| Pre-Money Valuation | $15.25M |
| Implied Ownership (at $750K) | 4.7% |

**Valuation Justification:**
1. **Founder Premium:** Former Head of Data Science at Circle (2021-2024) - rare pedigree
2. **Market Timing:** x402 V2 launched Dec 11, 2025 - first mover advantage
3. **Strategic Positioning:** Clear acquisition path to Circle (85% probability per GOAL doc)
4. **Product Readiness:** Private beta live, public launch imminent
5. **Comparable Companies:**
   - Daydreams: Raised at similar stage
   - OpenRouter: Growing rapidly in adjacent space
   - thirdweb: $24M Series A in 2024 for Web3 dev tools

### Instrument Type

**Recommended: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**

| SAFE Terms | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Valuation Cap | $16M |
| Discount | 20% (if uncapped) |
| Pro-rata Rights | Yes, for checks >$50K |
| MFN | Yes |
| Information Rights | Quarterly updates |

**Why SAFE over Priced Round:**
- Faster execution (1-2 weeks vs 4-6 weeks)
- Lower legal costs ($2K vs $15K+)
- Standard for angel/pre-seed in crypto
- Defer valuation negotiation to Seed

## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Circle (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Secure $200-300K from Circle alumni and closest connections

**Script for Circle Connections:**
```
Subject: Quick update + investment opportunity

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick update since we last connected -
I left Circle to build BlockRun, an x402 AI gateway that lets
agents pay for AI inference with USDC. Just launched private
beta on Christmas.

We're doing a small angel round ($500K-$1M) before our public
launch in January. Given your background at Circle and knowledge
of the space, thought you might be interested in learning more.

Would you have 20 mins this week to catch up? Happy to share
the deck.

Vicky
```

### Phase 2: Strategic Investors (Week 2-3)

**Goal:** Secure $200-300K from Coinbase connections and strategic VCs

**Key Targets:**
1. Ethan Oak (Coinbase Ventures) - may lead to CV check
2. Anand Gurumurthi (Stripe) - strategic validation
3. Tony Gu (NGC) - crypto-native credibility
4. Kevin Lee (L2 Iterative) - Base ecosystem focus

### Phase 3: Fill Round (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Secure remaining $150-300K from broader network

**Tactics:**
- Leverage momentum from confirmed investors
- Use social proof ("joining [X] and [Y]")
- Create FOMO with closing deadline

---
