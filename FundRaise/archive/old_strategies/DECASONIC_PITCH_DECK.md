**The Trust Layer for AI Payments**

---

## 1. The Shift

> "A verification layer would be necessary for continued adoption."
>
> "A layer for discoverability remains missing."
>
> — **Abdul Al Ali, The x402 Market Map, Oct 2025**

Payments are irreversible. No refunds. No chargebacks.

**You identified the gaps. I'm building the solution.**

> **SAY:** "Abdul, I read your market map. You called out exactly what's missing - verification and discoverability. Those are your words. That's what I'm building. That's why I wanted to talk to you."

---

## 2. The Problem

How does an AI know which service to trust before paying?

Right now, it doesn't.

- No idea which one to use
- No refunds
- No chargebacks
- No customer service

**Once an agent pays, the payment is final.**

> **SAY:** "x402 is powerful - but it's unforgiving. There's no undo button. Agents need to know who to trust before they spend."

---

## 3. BlockRun

**Phase 1 (Live Now):** AI Gateway
- 31 LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Pay-per-use with USDC, no API keys
- One line of code. Wallet = identity.

**Phase 2 (2026):** Trust Layer for All x402
- Reputation ratings for 700+ services
- Discovery across 618+ indexed services
- Verification: uptime, response times, fraud detection

Start with AI. Expand to everything.

> **SAY:** "We're live today with AI models - that's our proof of concept. We deliver what we promise. That credibility lets us become the trust layer for the entire x402 ecosystem. Start narrow, expand wide."

---

## 4. Why This Works

**AI Gateway** = wedge (proves we deliver)
**Trust Routing** = the business (where we scale)

| Daily Transactions | MRR |
|-------------------|-----|
| 10K | $1.5K |
| 1M | $150K |
| 100M | $15M |

*Based on $0.10 avg transaction, 5% Trust Routing fee*

> **SAY:** "The math is simple. Average x402 transaction is 10 cents. We take 5% on Trust Routing. At 1 million daily transactions, that's $150K MRR. At 100 million - which is where a16z projects the market heading - that's $15M monthly."

---

## 5. Traction

| What | Status |
|------|--------|
| AI Gateway | **LIVE** on Base mainnet |
| Coinbase x402 team | PR merged, feature requests open |
| PayAI partnership | Data sharing, joint research |
| Discovery data | Collecting all facilitator transactions daily |
| State of x402 report | Publishing with ecosystem data |

Not just building on x402. Building with the core team.

> **SAY:** "I'm not on the outside looking in. I've submitted PRs to the x402 repo, I have feature requests open with Coinbase. I'm working with PayAI on data sharing. And we're already collecting all facilitator transaction data daily - that's our discovery layer being built in real time."

---

## 6. Why Me

**Circle** — Head of Data Science, built USDC data infrastructure

**Capital One** — Director of Data Science, anti-fraud AI

**Microsoft** — Azure ML Tech Lead

I've built trust infrastructure for payments before. I'm building it again.

> **SAY:** "I spent three years at Circle building the data layer behind USDC. Before that, I built anti-fraud AI at Capital One. This is the exact intersection of what I've done my whole career - trust infrastructure for payments."

## 7. GotoMarket & Distribution

| Channel | Reach |
|---------|-------|
| Coinbase AgentKit | 10K+ agent devs |
| GOAT SDK | 150K downloads |
| nofx - AI trading Agent OS | 10K GitHub stars |

10 more Partner integration on the roadmap
Every integration = distribution.

> **SAY:** "We're already integrated with AgentKit, GOAT SDK, and nofx. That's 10K agent devs, 150K downloads, 10K GitHub stars. And we have 10 more partnerships on the roadmap. Every integration is distribution - this is how developer tools grow."

---

## 8. Why Now

x402 V2 launched December 11 2025

**Our Moat:** Already collecting discovery data across all x402 services. Every day we run, the data advantage grows.

A competitor in 2027 won't have 18 months of verified accuracy.

They'll have a pitch deck.

> **SAY:** "We're already collecting data on every x402 service - uptime, response times, transaction patterns. Every day that passes, our data advantage grows. Someone starting in 2027 can raise more money than me - but they can't buy 18 months of data."

---

## 9. The Ask

**$300K-500K Angel Round**

For acceleration and the right partners.

**Milestones This Unlocks:**
| Timeline | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Q1 2026 | 10+ Partnership integrations, $1K MRR |
| Q2 2026 | Public launch, Trust Ratings beta, $10K MRR |
| Q4 2026 | Multi-chain support, $50K MRR, Seed-ready |

**Key Risks:** x402 adoption pace, regulatory clarity on stablecoin payments

The right partners accelerate everything.

> **SAY:** "I'm not raising because I need the money. I exited Circle for eight figures. I'm raising because the right partners accelerate everything. Here's what this unlocks: 10 partnership integrations and $1K MRR by Q1, public launch and $10K MRR by Q2, multi-chain and $50K MRR by Q4. The risks are real - x402 adoption and regulatory clarity - but that's why timing matters."

## 10. BlockRun

The trust layer the ecosystem needs.

You identified the gap. We're filling it.

**I'm choosing partners who get it.**

> **SAY:** "You wrote the market map that describes exactly what I'm building. That's not a coincidence - that's why I'm here. I'm looking for partners who already understand the opportunity."
