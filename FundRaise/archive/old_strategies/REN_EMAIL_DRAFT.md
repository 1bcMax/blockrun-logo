## Option 1: Concise & Professional

**Subject**: Quick deck for tomorrow's call

Hi Ren,

Congratulations on the GP promotion - well deserved! Your path from cold DM to General Partner is inspiring.

Looking forward to updating you tomorrow. I've put together a deck with our progress since we last talked - we're live on Base, have an autonomous agent trading 24/7, and just opened our seed round.

See you tomorrow,

## Option 2: Warmer & Sets Expectations

**Subject**: Looking forward to tomorrow - BlockRun update

Hi Ren,

Congrats on General Partner! From cold DM in 2021 to GP at Electric - that's the kind of trajectory I respect. Well deserved.

Excited to update you tomorrow on BlockRun. Since we last talked, we:
- Went live on Base mainnet (AI Gateway processing real transactions)
- Built an autonomous Polymarket agent trading 24/7
- Got our PR merged into the Coinbase x402 repo

I've shared a deck below, but expecting our call to be more of a conversation than a formal walkthrough. Want to hear your thoughts on what we're seeing in the x402 ecosystem.

Hi Ren,

Congratulations on the GP promotion - your engineering-first approach to investing is what the industry needs.

Quick heads up for tomorrow: we're live on Base with the AI Gateway, have an autonomous trading agent running 24/7, and are opening our $2M seed round. Wanted to update you on progress and see if Electric wants to participate.
