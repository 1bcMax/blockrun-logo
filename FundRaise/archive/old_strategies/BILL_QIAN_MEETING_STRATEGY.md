---

## 对话方式（朋友聊天，不是pitch）

### 开场（像平时一样）
```
"Bill，最近怎么样？Cypher那边忙吗？"

[正常寒暄]

"对了，我想跟你分享一下我最近在做的事情。离开Circle之后，
我一直在build一个project，感觉时机到了，想听听你的想法。"
```

### 分享你在做的事（3-5 min）

```
"你知道我之前在Circle做了三年USDC的data infrastructure。
现在AI agents这波起来了，但有个问题 - agents没办法自己付钱买AI，
还是要靠人的API key。

我在做的就是让agents可以用USDC micropayments直接付钱用AI。
x402 V2刚出来两周，我们是第一个production deployment。"
```

### 核心价值（这是关键）

```
"但最有意思的不只是payment。

第一，通过这个gateway，我拿到了所有AI agent的transaction数据 -
谁在用什么model，用多少，付多少钱。
这个数据可以build AI agent reputation system。
现在没人有这个数据，我是第一个。

第二，我在推动x402的标准化。上周提交了一个protocol proposal，
让AI agents可以直接discover x402 services。
Coinbase team在review。我不只是在用这个protocol，
我在shape这个protocol。"
```

**GitHub链接（如果他想看）:**
https://github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/869

### 和Cypher Portfolio的关系

```
"你们投了CARV和Aethir，都是AI agent相关的。
BlockRun是payment layer + reputation data这一块。
我觉得是complementary的。"
```

### What He'll Care About

| His Interest | Your Answer |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Token potential** | "We're focused on product-market fit first, but token economics could make sense for the x402 ecosystem. Happy to discuss." |
| **Why now?** | "x402 V2 launched Dec 11 - first mover advantage. Coinbase + Cloudflare backing the protocol." |
| **Competition** | "Daydreams requires their token. OpenRouter is Web2. We're crypto-native, OpenAI-compatible, simplest integration." |
| **Exit path** | "Circle is #1 acquisition target - I know the team, they need this for USDC utility. Stripe, Cloudflare also logical." |
| **MENA angle** | "Permissionless = perfect for global access. No KYC, no accounts - anyone with a wallet can use AI." |

---

## KEY TALKING POINTS FOR BILL

### 1. Binance Labs Angle
> "You saw at Binance Labs what infrastructure plays can become.
> BlockRun is the payment infrastructure layer for AI agents -
> like how Binance became the infrastructure for trading."

### 2. JD.COM Payments Angle
> "From your JD.COM days - you know payments infrastructure is
> winner-take-most. We're building that for the AI agent economy."

### 3. CARV Synergy
> "You invested in CARV for AI agents. BlockRun is complementary -
> CARV does identity/data, we do the payment layer. Same ecosystem."

### 4. Token Discussion (If He Asks)
> "We're equity/SAFE focused for angel round. But the x402 ecosystem
> could support token mechanics - facilitator staking, fee sharing.
> Happy to explore if that's more interesting to Cypher."

---

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "Valuation seems high for pre-revenue"
> "Fair point. But consider: Circle Head of Data Science for 3 years,
> first mover in x402 V2, live product, AI + crypto intersection.
> Comparable AI agent infra companies are raising at $20-30M pre-seed.
> $16M is reasonable for this profile."

### "Why not just use existing payment rails?"
> "Traditional rails don't work for agents - no credit cards, no bank
> accounts. Agents need crypto-native payments. x402 is purpose-built
> for machine-to-machine micropayments."

### "What if x402 doesn't take off?"
> "Coinbase and Cloudflare are backing it. But even if x402 evolves,
> we're protocol-agnostic on the payment side. The value is the AI
> gateway abstraction layer."

### "How do you make money?"
> "2-5% transparent markup on AI inference costs. At scale with
> millions of agent transactions, this is significant revenue.
> Currently 0% markup during beta to drive adoption."

### "What's your unfair advantage?"
> "Three things: 1) First x402 V2 production deployment, 2) Circle
> insider knowledge of stablecoin infrastructure, 3) OpenAI 100%
> compatibility - easiest integration in the market."

---

## THE ASK

### Primary Ask
> "We're raising $750K at $16M post-money valuation. Looking for
> strategic angels who understand the AI + crypto intersection.
> Would love to have Cypher's backing - even a personal check
> from you would be meaningful signal."

### Suggested Check Size
- **Target:** $50K-100K
- **Minimum:** $25K
- If he wants larger: Open to $100K-250K from Cypher fund

### SAFE Terms
- $16M cap
- Standard YC SAFE
- Pro-rata rights for checks >$50K
- Information rights (quarterly updates)

---

If Bill invests, ask for:
1. **Intro to Aethir** - GPU infrastructure synergy
2. **Intro to CARV** - AI agents integration partner
3. **Dubai hub access** - potential MENA expansion
4. **Binance ecosystem intros** - if appropriate

---

update for Bill:


AI Agent Payment System: Building a USDC wallet-based payment system to enhance privacy and streamline transactions for web3 users.
Arbitrage Bot Development: A privacy-focused bot will facilitate anonymous USDC trading and wallet swaps on the Base blockchain.
Cross-Platform Integration: The system will connect various AI ecosystems to unify access, reputation, and historical data management.
Market Growth Potential: The team anticipates growth in AI-driven crypto finance as AI agents evolve and demand better payment capabilities.
Privacy and Compliance: Emphasizing secure, privacy-preserving tech ensures user trust while meeting regulatory standards during implementation.
Vision for Integration: Future plans include AI agent connections with everyday tech, simplifying user experiences through automated transaction management.
NotesAI Agent Payment and Ecosystem Development
The team decided to build an AI agent payment system centered on USDC wallets to enable seamless and privacy-preserving transactions within a growing crypto-native user base (16:05).

Vicky Fu outlined a plan for an AI agent arbitrage bot using a privacy-preserving model with API-based subscription access, targeting web3 users and focusing on USDC as the main payment currency (16:05).
The bot allows anonymous USDC trading and wallet-to-wallet swaps on the Base blockchain, addressing privacy concerns in decentralized finance.
Vicky emphasized that all AI agents should use USDC wallets for payments to build a future-proof ecosystem with transaction history, reputation, and performance reviews.
This approach supports native wallet integration without requiring API keyboards or hardware, simplifying the user experience.
The intent is to establish an AI agent payment standard that includes reputation tracking and transparent transaction records.

The system will connect multiple AI agent ecosystems, including Gemini and Chitata AI, to enable cross-platform access and unified reputation management (24:02).
Agents will keep historical data on payment and performance to foster trust and accountability.
Vicky mentioned plans for a reputation system to maintain agent performance history and user feedback, improving the decision-making process for users.


Strategic Market Positioning and Future Growth
The team views the AI agent payment system as a long-term investment to capture emerging market opportunities in AI-driven crypto finance (16:05).

Vicky described the market as currently niche but growing, with potential to become a standard for AI agents in crypto payments, especially as AI agents increasingly require integrated wallets and payment capabilities (16:05).
They expect growth driven by the rise of AI agents that can autonomously trade and interact with blockchain assets.
The focus on USDC ensures broad compatibility and stable value, critical for adoption in volatile crypto markets.
Bill Qian acknowledged the banking-related use cases and expressed openness to explore further market applications (35:35).

The plan includes evolving token models possibly into a token war or enhanced token utility tied to transaction volume and blockchain trading data, which could drive engagement and monetization (29:09).
Vicky hinted at leveraging transaction history and trading data as competitive differentiators for future platform enhancements.
This strategy aligns with building a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates payments, reputation, and AI agent performance data.


Technical and Operational Implementation
The AI agent payment system will use privacy-preserving technology and blockchain integration to meet user needs and regulatory requirements (16:05).

Vicky stressed the importance of removing privacy barriers by designing an AI agent that does not expose user API keys or sensitive hardware data, relying instead on USDC wallets for transaction handling.
This design lowers friction and increases trust among users wary of data leaks.
The integration will enable agents to autonomously manage trades and payments while keeping users’ private data secure.

Implementation includes setting up subscription-based API access to manage arbitrage bot services, with a pricing model around 0.1 cents per token as an initial cost estimate (11:03).
The team plans to preload tokens and manage forbidden countries to comply with regulations.
Bill Qian highlighted the need to watch privacy and compliance constraints closely during rollout (14:20).

The system will support seamless cross-agent access and payment history sharing, allowing users to interact with multiple AI agents across platforms without repetitive onboarding (24:02).

Vision for AI Agent Integration and User Experience
The leadership sees AI agent payments as part of a broader shift toward autonomous, integrated digital services spanning finance and everyday tasks (38:34).

Vicky painted a future with AI agents connected to self-driving cars, chat systems, and search engines, all using unified USDC wallets for payments and data exchange (38:34).
This vision focuses on simplifying complex user settings into a seamless experience where the AI agent manages all transactions and interactions.
The approach aims to reduce user burden while increasing engagement through trusted, automated payment flows.

Bill Qian expressed agreement with this long-term vision, noting the potential for banking and financial services to adopt similar AI agent payment standards (35:35).
The team acknowledged the complexity but sees it as necessary for sustainable growth and broader market adoption.
They are positioning the product to lead in this space by combining privacy, interoperability, and user-friendly design.

Vicky highlighted that the reputation system will be key to building trust in this ecosystem, ensuring users can rely on agent performance data when choosing services (26:12).

---

### WHAT TO IMPROVE

#### 1. Message Clarity

The conversation covered many topics:
- AI agent payments
- Arbitrage bots
- Privacy-preserving trading
- Reputation systems
- Token economics
- Future integrations (cars, search)

**For follow-up:** Simplify to ONE core message:
> "BlockRun is Stripe for AI agents. USDC payments on Base. First x402 deployment."

#### 2. Business Plan Was Missing

Bill asked for a business plan - you didn't have one ready.

**Status:** ✅ Now completed - `BLOCKRUN_BUSINESS_PLAN.md`

#### 3. No Valuation Discussion Yet

Valuation wasn't discussed in this meeting.

**Opportunity:** You can anchor high when you send the business plan:
> "Raising $750K. KiteAI raised $15M seed from PayPal/General Catalyst for same thesis. Happy to discuss valuation - what range works for you?"

#### 4. No Direct Ask Yet

The meeting was exploratory. Next step is to make a clear ask.

**In follow-up email:**
> "Bill, I'd love a $50K check from you personally. Can we discuss terms this week?"

---

### PITCH IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

#### The 10-Second Test

Can you explain BlockRun in 10 seconds? If not, it's too complex.

**Current (too long):**
> "AI agent payment system with USDC wallets, arbitrage bot, reputation system, cross-platform integration, token economics, privacy-preserving model..."

**Better (10 seconds):**
> "BlockRun is Stripe for AI agents. Any agent can pay for AI with USDC. We're first to market."

#### The Traction > Vision Rule

Bill has deployed $20 billion. He's heard every vision pitch. What moves him:

| Weak (Vision) | Strong (Traction) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "AI agents will use USDC" | "We processed X transactions this week" |
| "We'll build reputation" | "We have X AI agents using our API" |
| "Future token model" | "2% margin = $X revenue at Y transactions" |

**Your strongest traction points to emphasize:**
1. First x402 V2 production deployment (Dec 11)
2. Live on Base mainnet now
3. 50+ AI models, OpenAI-compatible
4. Circle Head of Data Science 3 years

#### The Objection Prep Matrix

Before any pitch, prep answers for predictable objections:

| Objection | Prepared Answer |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "Regulatory risk?" | "USDC is regulated. We're a gateway, not custodian. Standard OFAC compliance." |
| "Why not OpenRouter?" | "OpenRouter is Web2. We're crypto-native with wallet payments." |
| "Token model?" | "Equity for angel round. Token mechanics for ecosystem growth post-traction." |
| "Valuation high?" | "Comparable AI agent infra at $20-30M. $16M with my background is fair." |
| "What's live now?" | "50+ models, Base mainnet, x402 payments working today." |

---

### RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TO BILL

Send within 24 hours with business plan attached:

```
Subject: BlockRun Business Plan + Next Steps

Bill,

Great discussion yesterday. As promised, here's the business plan.

ONE SENTENCE: BlockRun = Stripe for AI agents, USDC payments on Base.

KEY POINTS:
1. First x402 V2 production deployment (live Dec 11)
2. 50+ AI models, drop-in OpenAI-compatible API
3. Live on Base mainnet today at blockrun.ai

MARKET CONTEXT:
- KiteAI just raised $18M Series A from PayPal + General Catalyst (same thesis)
- PIN AI raised $10M pre-seed for AI agents
- We're asking for less capital with stronger founder credentials

CYPHER FIT: Complements CARV (identity) + Aethir (compute).
BlockRun is the payment layer. Complete the AI agent stack.

THE ASK: $750K angel round. Happy to discuss valuation -
what range works for you?

Would love a $50K check from you personally. Can we talk terms this week?

Best,
Vicky

### 1-MINUTE PITCH SCRIPT (Improved)

Use this structure for all future investor conversations:

**Hook (10 sec):**
> "You know how AI agents are everywhere now? They can write code, trade crypto, book flights. But they can't pay for anything - still need human API keys."

**Problem (15 sec):**
> "This is the bottleneck. Agents need to pay for AI services themselves - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini. But there's no payment rail built for machines."

**Solution (15 sec):**
> "BlockRun is Stripe for AI agents. Any agent can pay for AI with USDC - no API keys, no human in the loop. Drop-in OpenAI-compatible API."

**Why Us (10 sec):**
> "I spent 3 years as Head of Data Science at Circle building USDC infrastructure. We're the first production deployment on x402 - the Coinbase/Cloudflare payment protocol."

**Traction (10 sec):**
> "We're live on Base mainnet. 50+ AI models. OpenAI-compatible means any existing agent works with one line change."

**Ask (10 sec):**
> "Raising $750K at $16M. Looking for $50K checks from people who understand AI + crypto. Can you commit this week?"

**TOTAL: 60 seconds. Practice until it flows naturally.**

---

### PITCH MISTAKES TO AVOID

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Talking about 5 products | Investor confusion | ONE product, ONE message |
| Future vision without current traction | Sounds like dreaming | Lead with what's live NOW |
| Token discussion without model | Looks unprepared | Either have specifics or say "equity-focused" |
| Not addressing obvious concerns | Leaves doubts unresolved | Proactively answer compliance, competition |
| Not closing | Investor forgets | Always ask with timeline: "Can you commit by X?" |
| Letting investor give YOU action items | You lost control | Your action items TO them: "I'll send docs, you wire by Friday" |

---

### BILL QIAN - SPECIFIC FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

**Current Status:** High interest - requested business plan

**What He Asked For:**
1. ✅ Business plan - NOW READY (`BLOCKRUN_BUSINESS_PLAN.md`)

**What's Still Open:**
1. Valuation - not discussed yet (you can anchor with KiteAI/PinAI comps)
2. Check size - suggest $50K, open to $25-100K
3. Timeline - create urgency with "closing mid-January"

**Follow-up Actions:**

| Action | Timeline | Goal |
|--------|----------|------|
| Send business plan + email | **Today** | Deliver what he asked for |
| Let him suggest valuation first | In email | "What range works for you?" |
| Propose call to discuss terms | Within 48 hours | Move to commitment |
| Create urgency | In email | "Closing round mid-January" |
| If no response in 3 days | Soft follow-up | "Did you get a chance to review?" |
| If positive response | Send SAFE docs | Close the deal |

**Valuation Strategy:**
- Don't lead with a number - ask what works for him
- If he asks first, anchor at $18-20M ("KiteAI raised at similar stage")
- Willing to close at $15M for quick commitment
- Floor: $12M (don't go below this)

**Best Case:** He commits $50-100K at $15-20M
**Likely Case:** He commits $25-50K, may negotiate valuation down
**Alternative:** He passes personally but intros to Cypher network investors

---

### KEY LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE PITCHES

1. **Simplicity wins.** One clear message beats five interesting ideas.

2. **Close every meeting.** Never leave without asking for commitment + timeline.

3. **Prepare for obvious objections.** If you can predict the question, have the answer ready.

4. **Traction > Vision.** What's live matters more than what could be.

5. **Control the conversation.** Don't let the investor drive - you're selling, they're buying.

6. **Know when to stop.** If they're interested, don't oversell. Get the commitment and stop talking.
