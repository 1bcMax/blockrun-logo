Subject: Quick catch-up + what I'm building

Hi [Name],

Hope all is well! I wanted to share what I've been building since leaving Circle.

I launched BlockRun - the first x402 V2 AI gateway that lets agents pay for
AI inference with USDC micropayments. Every payment is in USDC on Base.

We're doing a small friends & family angel round before public launch
(Jan 6-7). Given your deep knowledge of USDC and the space, I'd love
to have you as an investor.

Can we grab 20 mins to catch up? Happy to send the deck.

Best,
Vicky
```

**Ethan Oak Special Strategy:**
- This is your most important non-Circle contact

- Even if CV doesn't invest, his angel check is valuable signal
