# BlockRun Investor Memo

**Friends & Family Round**
**December 2025**

---

## The One-Liner

BlockRun is the payment + discovery layer for AI agents — built by an x402 protocol contributor, capturing the only AI agent transaction dataset in the market.

---

## Why Now

**December 11, 2025:** Coinbase and Cloudflare launched x402 V2, the first production-ready protocol for machine-to-machine payments.

**December 25, 2025:** BlockRun launched as the first x402 V2 AI gateway.

We have a 2-week head start in a market that will define how AI agents interact with the economy.

---

## The Problem

AI agents today are not truly autonomous. They depend on human API keys to access AI.

- Every AI agent today uses a human's OpenAI/Anthropic API key
- Humans pay the bills, set the limits, control access
- Agents can't pay for their own compute
- No identity, no reputation, no economic autonomy

**This is the bottleneck for the AI agent economy.**

---

## The Solution

BlockRun lets AI agents pay for AI inference directly with USDC micropayments.

```
One line of code. Five minutes to integrate. 100% OpenAI compatible.
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent sends request to BlockRun
2. BlockRun routes to AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
3. Agent pays per-request in USDC via x402
4. No API keys. No accounts. Wallet = identity.

---

## The Real Value Prop: Data + Discovery

**Payment is just the wedge.**

By operating the gateway, BlockRun captures something no one else has:

### AI Agent Transaction Data

Every request through BlockRun generates:
- Which agent made the request
- Which wallet paid
- Which model was used
- How much was paid
- Request/response patterns
- Usage over time

### Discovery = Network Effect

My [x402 Well-Known Endpoint proposal](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/869) enables:

```
AI agents discover x402 services directly →
They find BlockRun →
We capture their transaction data →
We build their reputation
```

**Discovery feeds data. Data builds reputation. Reputation creates lock-in.**

**This is the foundation for AI Agent Reputation.**

### What We Can Build

| Data Point | Reputation Signal |
|------------|-------------------|
| Payment history | Creditworthiness |
| Usage patterns | Agent type/purpose |
| Model preferences | Capability level |
| Transaction volume | Economic activity |
| Wallet associations | Network/ecosystem |

**No one else has this data. We are first.**

## Why Me

**Vicky Fu — Founder**

### Circle Background (2021-2024)
- **Former Head of Data Science, Circle**
- Built the data infrastructure behind USDC
- Processed billions in stablecoin transactions
- Deep relationships across Circle leadership

### x402 Protocol Leader

**Not just using x402 — shaping it.**

I authored the [x402 Well-Known Endpoint Standardization Proposal](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/869), which introduces:

| Proposal | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| `/.well-known/x402` endpoint | Direct service discovery without facilitators |
| Self-reporting capabilities | Services declare their own x402 metadata |
| AI agent native discovery | Agents find x402 services directly |

**Why this matters:**
- First production x402 deployment (BlockRun)
- First major protocol enhancement proposal
- Positioned as thought leader, not just user
- Direct relationship with Coinbase x402 team

### Founder-Market Fit
- Built USDC data infra at Circle (2021-2024) → Now building AI agent payment infra
- Understands stablecoin ecosystem from inside
- Now contributing to the protocol layer

---

## Traction

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Private beta | Live (Dec 25, 2025) |
| Public launch | Jan 6-7, 2026 |
| x402 V2 integration | First production deployment |
| OpenAI compatibility | 100% drop-in replacement |
| SDK | npm + PyPI packages ready |

**Partnerships in discussion:**
- AgentKit (Coinbase)
- Virtuals Protocol
- GOAT Framework
- MCP ecosystem

---

## Business Model

### Phase 1: Payment Gateway (Now)
- 2-5% transparent markup on AI inference
- Currently 0% during beta to drive adoption
- Unit economics positive from day one

### Phase 2: Reputation Layer (2026)
- AI agent credit scoring
- Risk assessment for agent transactions
- Premium data products for agent platforms

### Phase 3: Agent Financial Services (2027+)
- Agent credit lines
- Agent-to-agent payment rails
- Cross-chain agent identity

---

## Market

**AI Agent Infrastructure is exploding:**
- Virtuals Protocol: AI agent tokens
- CARV: AI agent identity/data
- Aethir: Decentralized GPU
- AgentKit: Coinbase agent framework

**What's missing: Payment + Reputation layer**

BlockRun fills this gap.

---

## Exit Path

### Primary: Circle Acquisition (85% probability)

- I know the team — worked there 3 years
- BlockRun drives USDC utility
- AI agent payments = USDC killer app
- Strategic fit is obvious

**Target: $500M+ by 2027**

### Secondary Options
- Stripe (just acquired Bridge for $1B)
- Coinbase (building AgentKit)
- Cloudflare (backing x402)

## The Round

**Friends & Family Angel Round**

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Instrument | SAFE (YC standard) |
| Valuation Cap | $16M |
| Target Raise | $500K - $800K |
| Minimum Check | $20K |
| Use of Funds | Engineering, partnerships, infrastructure |

---

## Why Invest

1. **Protocol leader** — Not just using x402, authoring protocol standards
2. **First mover** — Only x402 V2 AI gateway in production
3. **Unique data** — Only company capturing AI agent transaction data
4. **Discovery moat** — My proposal makes BlockRun the default discovery endpoint
5. **Founder-market fit** — 3 years building USDC infrastructure at Circle (2021-2024)
6. **Clear exit** — Circle acquisition path is obvious
