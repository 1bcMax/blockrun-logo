## AI Agents Need Someone to Trust

In 2025, AI agents learned to spend money.

A new payment standard called x402 allows AI software to pay for services automatically—no human clicking "buy." The market responded: over 100 million transactions and an estimated $600 million in volume this year alone, according to x402.org ecosystem data and industry reports from November 2025.

But there's a catch. These payments can't be reversed. Once an AI sends money, there's no refund button, no customer service, no chargeback. The payment is final.

So how does an AI know which service to trust before paying?

Right now, it doesn't. And that's the problem BlockRun solves.

## What We're Building

Think of BlockRun as the Yelp for AI payments.

We rate services in the ecosystem so AI agents know who to trust. Is this service legitimate? Does it actually deliver what it promises? Is the price fair compared to alternatives? We answer these questions, and AI agents pay a small fee to access our ratings.

We have two products. The first is our AI Gateway, which is live today. We sell access to 31 AI models—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others—on a pay-per-use basis. No accounts, no subscriptions. An AI agent simply pays and gets a response. This product is our wedge into the market and our proof of credibility. We deliver what we promise—and that track record gives us the authority to rate others.

The second product is our Trust Rating system, currently in development and launching Q1 2026. We're tracking over 700 services in the ecosystem, monitoring their uptime, response times, and transaction patterns. Our analysis shows that 40-50% of current activity shows signs of fraud or manipulation—services gaming their metrics to look more popular than they are. We flag these.

A fair question: who validates BlockRun's ratings? Our answer is transparency. The scoring methodology will be open-sourced. Uptime data, response times, and transaction patterns are all on-chain and independently verifiable. Anyone can audit our work. Trust infrastructure only works if it's auditable.

## The Business

Our revenue comes from two streams. On the AI Gateway, we take a 2-5% markup on usage. On Trust Routing, we charge 5% of every payment we route.

To be direct: the Gateway alone isn't a venture-scale business. AI proxy margins are thin and getting thinner. The Gateway is our wedge—it gets us into the ecosystem and builds our credibility. Trust Routing is the real business. When agents route payments through us for verified services, that 5% fee is paying for confidence, not convenience. That's a different value proposition.

The average transaction in this ecosystem is about 24 cents. Our 5% cut is just over a penny per transaction. That sounds small, but volume is everything in payments.

Our first distribution unlock is Coinbase AgentKit—launching Q1 2026, with access to 10,000+ agent developers. From there, we're integrating with GOAT SDK and LangChain. At one million daily transactions—our target for mid-2027—that's $360,000 in monthly revenue, with Trust Routing as the majority contributor.

## Why Me

I was Tech Lead for Azure ML & AI at Microsoft, then Director of Data Science at Capital One building anti-fraud AI systems. After that, I spent nearly three years at Circle as Head of Data Science, building the data infrastructure behind USDC—the stablecoin that now moves billions daily. I understand how AI systems work, how payment systems work, how to detect fraud, and how to build trust infrastructure at scale.

When I saw the x402 ecosystem emerging, I recognized the gap immediately. The payment rails exist. What's missing is the trust layer. That's exactly what I spent three years building at Circle, and I'm building it again for AI payments.

## Where We Are

The AI Gateway is live and processing payments. We've integrated 31 AI models and indexed over 618 services in our directory. The trust scoring algorithm is built; we're launching it publicly in Q1 2026.

We're raising $500K to hire two engineers, expand our service monitoring infrastructure, and reach our first major milestones: $50K in monthly revenue, 500+ developers, and 100,000 daily transactions. Those metrics position us for a Seed round in late 2026.

## Why Now

I'm not going to claim that first mover always wins. Visa wasn't the first card network. Stripe wasn't the first payment API. In trust infrastructure, being the most credible matters more than being the earliest.

But credibility is built through track record. The longer we operate with accurate ratings and reliable service, the harder we become to displace. A competitor launching in 2027 won't have 18 months of verified accuracy. They'll have a pitch deck.

The window isn't about being first. It's about starting the clock on trust.

The market just crossed $600 million in volume. It's real, it's growing, and it has a trust problem that no one else is solving. Payment processors in this ecosystem won't rate each other—Coinbase won't tell you that a competitor's service is better. They have to stay neutral.

BlockRun doesn't have that constraint. We're not a payment processor. We're the rating layer that sits on top. That neutrality is our structural advantage.
