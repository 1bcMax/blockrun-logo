# How to Create x402 Hackathon Logo Grid Image

## Method 1: Use the HTML File (Fastest)

I created `x402_hackathon_logo_grid.html` for you.

**Steps:**
1. Open `x402_hackathon_logo_grid.html` in Chrome or Safari
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + 4` (Mac) or use Screenshot tool
3. Drag to select the white container area
4. Save as `x402_hackathon_projects.png`
5. Attach to your X thread

**Pros:**
- Fast (30 seconds)
- Clean design
- All projects alphabetically organized
- Gradient backgrounds look professional

**Cons:**
- Uses initials instead of actual logos
- Generic design

## Method 2: Get Real Logos (Best Quality)

If you want actual project logos:

**Step 1: Collect Logos**

Visit each project's X profile and download their logo:

1. @aswinrajkailath - AgentARC
2. @dipesh_sukhani - AgentECHO
3. @PIsajeski - Agentokratia
4. @AiMoNetwork - aimo.bet
5. @kamalbuilds - DCA Platform
6. @MuseionAI - Museion MVP
7. @SolChadNFTs - OOBE Synapse Gateway
8. @timdaub - On-chain Search Agent
9. @rawgroundbeef - OpenFacilitator
10. @bc1beat - Polymarket MultiAgent
11. @TheSpartanLabs - Simmer
12. @CrackedUnc - Slophouse Cinema
13. @termix_ai - Termix
14. @Texas_Arena - Texas Arena
15. @0xMGLV - Verifiable Green Compute
16. @gamerWhogames_ - WebAuthn/FIDO2
17. @maxbuidl - x402MKT
18. @x402rorg - x402r
19. @_krisgg - YODA.FUN
20. @BlockRunAI - BlockRun (you!)

**Step 2: Use Figma or Canva**

**Figma (Free):**
- Create 1400x1200px canvas
- Create 4x5 grid (20 squares)
- Each square: 280x200px
- Drop logos in, add project names below
- Export as PNG

**Canva (Easier):**
- Search "Logo Grid" template
- Replace with your logos
- Add text labels
- Download as PNG

## Method 3: Use AI Image Generator (Experimental)

You could try generating with:
- DALL-E: "Create a professional logo grid showing 20 AI projects..."
- Midjourney: Similar prompt
- But this is hit-or-miss for text/logos

## Method 4: Hire Designer on Fiverr (Fast + Professional)

**Cost:** $10-30
**Time:** 2-24 hours

**What to send them:**

```

## Method 5: Screenshot the HTML + Quick Edit (2 Minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Open `x402_hackathon_logo_grid.html`
2. Screenshot it
3. Open in Preview (Mac) or Paint (Windows)
4. Crop to just the white container
5. Save as PNG

## What I Recommend

**If posting in next 1-2 hours:**
- Use Method 1 (HTML screenshot)
- It looks clean and professional
- All projects tagged properly

**If posting tomorrow:**
- Use Method 4 (Fiverr designer)
- Get actual logos
- Worth $20 for polish

**If you have Figma skills:**
- Use Method 2
- Full control
- Best quality

---

## Twitter Image Specs

**Optimal sizes for X:**
- Single image: 1200x675px (16:9)
- Square: 1200x1200px
- Portrait: 1200x1500px

The HTML I created renders at ~1400x1200px which is PERFECT for Twitter.

## Alternative: Just Use Text

Honestly, you might not even need the logo grid image. The Twitter thread I wrote is strong on its own.

**If you skip the image:**
- Thread still works great
- Projects get tagged and will RT
- Saves you time
- Focus on writing quality

**If you include the image:**
- More visual appeal
- Shows "20+ projects" at a glance
- Better engagement (images get 2-3x likes)
- Worth it if you have 30 min

---

## My Recommendation

Use the HTML file (`x402_hackathon_logo_grid.html`):

1. Open in browser
2. Zoom to 100%
3. Screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4)
4. Crop
5. Attach to Tweet 1 or 2

This takes 2 minutes and looks professional.

If you want PERFECT quality with real logos, hire a Fiverr designer for $20 and post tomorrow instead.
