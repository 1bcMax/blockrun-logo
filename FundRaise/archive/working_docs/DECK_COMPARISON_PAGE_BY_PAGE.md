## Page 1: Title Slide

### What's On The Slide:
- **BlockRun**
- The Trust Layer for AI Agent Payments

### Talk Track:
*"BlockRun is building the trust infrastructure for AI agent payments. Think Yelp for x402 services - we rate which services AI agents can trust before they pay."*

**Duration**: 10 seconds

---

## Page 2: The Pattern

### What's On The Slide:
- Table showing trust infrastructure timeline:
  - 1958: Consumer credit → FICO (30 years)
  - 1994: E-commerce → SSL/Verisign (10 years)
  - 2007: Mobile payments → Device fingerprinting (5 years)
  - 2026: AI agent payments → **?**

### Talk Track:
*"Every payment system needs trust infrastructure before it scales. Credit cards needed FICO. E-commerce needed SSL. Mobile payments needed device fingerprinting.*

*x402 v2 just launched in December 2025. AI agents can now pay for services automatically with USDC - irreversibly.*

*The payment rails exist. The trust layer doesn't. That's what BlockRun is building."*

### Key Points:
- Pattern: trust infrastructure takes time to build (30 → 10 → 5 years)
- x402 is the new payment system
- Trust layer is the obvious missing piece

**Duration**: 45 seconds

---

## Page 3: The Problem

### What's On The Slide:
- "How does an AI know which service to trust before paying?"
- "Right now, it doesn't."
- Bullet points:
  - No idea which one to use
  - No refunds
  - No chargebacks
  - No customer service
- "Once an agent pays, the payment is final."

### Talk Track:
*"x402 payments are irreversible. No refunds, no chargebacks, no customer service. Once an AI agent sends USDC, the payment is final.*

*So how does an AI know which service to trust before paying? Right now, it doesn't.*

*We analyzed 700+ x402 services and found: services disappear after collecting payments, response times vary 100x between providers offering identical APIs, and agents have no historical reliability data. They pay first, discover quality after.*

*An AI managing a $10,000 portfolio has no way to know if a $0.10 API call will return valid data or drain funds."*

### Key Points:
- Payments are irreversible (emphasize this)
- 700+ services analyzed (proprietary insight)
- Real financial risk for autonomous agents

**Duration**: 60 seconds

---

## Page 4: BlockRun Solution

### What's On The Slide:
**Phase 1 (Live Now): AI Gateway**
- 31 LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Pay-per-use with USDC, no API keys
- One line of code. Wallet = identity.

**Phase 2 (2026): Trust Layer for All x402**
- Reputation ratings for 700+ services
- Discovery across 618+ indexed services
- Verification: uptime, response times, fraud detection

### Talk Track:
*"We're building this in phases. Phase 1 is our AI Gateway - live now on Base mainnet. 31 AI models, pay-per-use with USDC, no accounts needed. Your wallet is your identity. It's one line of code.*

*This is our wedge. It proves we can deliver reliable services on x402.*

*Phase 2 launches Q1 2026 - trust ratings for all 700+ x402 services. We track uptime, response times, and fraud patterns. Open methodology, verifiable scoring.*

*Phase 3 in 2027 is the Agent Credit Bureau - reputation scores for AI agents themselves, enabling credit and settlement for machine-to-machine commerce."*

### Key Points:
- Phase 1 = wedge (builds credibility)
- Phase 2 = core business (trust ratings)
- Phase 3 = long-term moat (agent identity/credit)
- **NOTE**: If Phase 3 is missing from PDF, add it or mention it verbally

**Duration**: 75 seconds

---

## Page 5: Our Strategy

### What's On The Slide:
- "Our Strategy: A Wedge to Build the Network"
- AI Gateway = wedge (proves we deliver)
- Trust Routing = the business (where we scale)
- Revenue projections mentioned

### Talk Track:
*"Our strategy is simple: the AI Gateway is the wedge that proves we deliver. Trust Routing is the business where we scale.*

*The Gateway alone isn't venture-scale - AI proxy margins are thin. But it gets us into the ecosystem and builds credibility. When agents start routing payments through us for verified services, that 5% fee is paying for confidence, not just convenience. That's a different value proposition."*

### Key Points:
- Be honest: Gateway alone isn't enough
- Trust Routing is the real business
- Wedge → credibility → routing volume

**Duration**: 45 seconds

---

## Page 6: Traction & Partnerships

### What's On The Slide:
- "We're Building With the Core Team, Not Just On the Protocol"
- Traction & Key Milestones:
  - AI Gateway LIVE on Base mainnet
  - Coinbase x402 team: PR merged, feature requests open
  - PayAI partnership: Data sharing, joint research
  - Discovery data: Collecting all facilitator transactions daily
  - State of x402 report: Publishing with ecosystem data

### Talk Track:
*"We're not just building on x402 - we're building with the core team at Coinbase. We have a PR merged into their repo, open feature requests, and direct collaboration.*

*We partnered with PayAI for data sharing and joint research. We're collecting transaction data from all major facilitators daily - this becomes our trust rating dataset.*

*We published the State of x402 report that got over 2,000 engagements. The ecosystem recognizes us as the data and trust experts."*

### Key Points:
- Emphasize Coinbase collaboration (builds credibility)
- PayAI partnership (data access)
- State of x402 report (thought leadership)

**Duration**: 60 seconds

---

## Page 7: Infrastructure Positioning

### What's On The Slide:
- "We are building the layer every x402 application needs."
- Stack diagram:
  - **Top**: Applications (trading bots, research agents)
  - **Middle**: Trust Layer (BlockRun) ← **your layer**
  - **Bottom**: Protocol (x402, USDC, Base)
- "Applications come and go. Infrastructure compounds."

### Talk Track:
*"We're not building an application that uses x402. We're building the layer that every x402 application needs.*

*Applications come and go. Infrastructure compounds. Every trading bot, research agent, and AI tool needs to know which services to trust. That's our layer."*

### Key Points:
- Infrastructure play, not application
- Compounding vs ephemeral value
- Every application needs trust

**Duration**: 30 seconds

---

## Page 8: The Moat

### What's On The Slide:
- "Our moat is interpretation, not information."
- Table of compounding assets:
  - **Methodology**: Scoring algorithms refined through thousands of edge cases
  - **Historical Depth**: 18 months by mid-2027
  - **SDK Relationships**: Embedded in developer workflows
  - **Brand Trust**: Services want verification, agents trust scores
- "A competitor starting in Q3 2026 can see the same blockchain data..."

### Talk Track:
*"Raw transaction data is on-chain - anyone can read it. Our moat is interpretation, not information.*

*Our moat compounds in four ways: scoring methodology refined through thousands of edge cases, historical depth - we'll have 18 months of measurements by mid-2027, SDK relationships embedded in developer workflows, and brand trust.*

*A competitor starting in Q3 2026 can see the same blockchain data. They cannot replicate 8 months of uptime measurements, latency distributions, and calibrated fraud signals.*

*Trust infrastructure is built through track record."*

### Key Points:
- Data is public, interpretation is proprietary
- Four compounding advantages
- Time-based moat (historical data)

**Duration**: 60 seconds

---

## Page 9: Distribution

### What's On The Slide:
- "Distribution is Built-In Through Partner Integrations"
- Initial Distribution Channels:
  - Coinbase AgentKit: ~10K+ agent devs
  - GOAT SDK: 150K downloads
  - nofx - AI trading Agent OS: 10K GitHub stars
  - 10 more partner integrations on the roadmap
- "Every integration = distribution."

### Talk Track:
*"Developer tools grow through SDK integrations, not marketing. We ship code to repositories. Developers discover us through their tools.*

*Coinbase AgentKit gives us access to 10,000+ agent developers. GOAT SDK has 150,000 downloads. nofx has 10,000 GitHub stars. Each integration distributes us to their entire developer base.*

*We have 10 more integrations on the roadmap. This is how infrastructure scales."*

### Key Points:
- SDK integration strategy (not consumer marketing)
- Three key partnerships already
- 10 more in pipeline

**Duration**: 45 seconds

---

## Page 10: Traction

*We have code merged into Coinbase's x402 repo, active partnership with PayAI, and a fully autonomous agent running live as proof of concept."*

### Key Points:
- Live = de-risked
- User demand (Solana requests)
- Multiple validation points

**Duration**: 30 seconds

---

## Page 11: Live Demo

### What's On The Slide:
- "Proof: A live autonomous agent using our infrastructure."
- Polymarket Agent details:
  - Manages its own wallet with USDC on Polygon
  - Uses BlockRun AI Gateway to analyze via GPT, Claude, Gemini
  - Places real trades with real money
  - Runs 24/7
- "The product is live. Users are asking for more chains."

### Talk Track:
*"Let me show you proof. We built a fully autonomous Polymarket trading agent.*

*It manages its own USDC wallet on Polygon. Uses BlockRun's AI Gateway to analyze prediction markets via GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Places real trades with real money. Runs 24/7.*

*This is a live agent using our infrastructure to access AI, make decisions, and execute transactions - completely autonomously. You can watch it trade right now."*

### Key Points:
- Live demo = proof of thesis
- Real money, real trades
- Showcase during pitch if possible (pull up URL)

**Demo URL**: polymarket-agent-tokyo.run.app

**Duration**: 45 seconds

## Page 12: Business Model

### What's On The Slide:
- "A simple model: capture a small fee on a massive volume of transactions."
- Revenue Streams:
  - AI Gateway: 5% markup (Proves delivery, generates cash)
  - Trust Routing: 5% of routed volume (Where we scale)
- Revenue Projections:
  - 1M transactions: $5K - $10K
  - 10M: $50K - $100K
  - 100M: $500K - $1M

### Talk Track:
*"Two revenue streams: AI Gateway charges 5% markup - this proves we deliver and generates cash. Trust Routing charges 5% on routed payments - this is where we scale.*

*Average transaction is 10 cents. Our 5% is half a penny. But volume is everything in payments.*

*At 1 million daily transactions - our target for mid-2027 - that's $360K in monthly revenue, with Trust Routing as the majority."*

### Key Points:
- Two revenue streams (Gateway + Routing)
- Small fee x massive volume
- Trust Routing > Gateway over time

**Duration**: 45 seconds

## Page 13: Why Me

### What's On The Slide:
- "Built Trust Infrastructure for Billions at Circle."
- **Vicky Fu, Founder**
  - Circle — Head of Data Science. Built data infrastructure for USDC.
  - Capital One — Director, Data Science. Led anti-fraud AI.
  - Microsoft — Azure ML Tech Lead.

### Talk Track:
*"I spent the last decade building trust infrastructure for payments.*

*At Circle, I was Head of Data Science - built the data infrastructure underlying USDC, designed monitoring systems for billions in stablecoin flows, and shipped the analytics that institutions use to trust Circle.*

*At Capital One, I led anti-fraud AI for consumer credit - evaluating millions of transactions daily.*

*Before that, I was Tech Lead for Azure ML at Microsoft.*

*The x402 ecosystem needs what I built at Circle: trust infrastructure that makes money move safely. The difference: this time it's for machines, not institutions."*

### Key Points:
- Circle = USDC trust infrastructure (directly relevant)
- Capital One = fraud/trust expertise
- "For machines, not institutions" = powerful framing

**Duration**: 60 seconds

*40% goes to engineering - senior infrastructure and ML engineers to accelerate Trust Ratings launch.*

*30% to integrations - SDK partnerships, AgentKit launch, multi-chain expansion.*

*30% to operations - infrastructure costs, go-to-market, community.*

*Key milestones: Trust Ratings beta in Q2 2026. $10K MRR by Q4 2026. $50K MRR by Q2 2027. $100K MRR and 100,000 daily transactions by Q4 2027.*

*This 24-month runway establishes BlockRun as the default trust layer for x402."*

### Key Points:
- $2M seed, 24 months
- Clear allocation (engineering heavy)
- Aggressive but achievable milestones
- End state: "default trust layer"

**Duration**: 60 seconds

## Backup Slides / Appendix

**If you have time or get technical questions:**

### Technical Proof Points:
- Open source contributions (Coinbase x402 repo)
- Live infrastructure specs (31 models, sub-second settlement)
- Monitoring coverage (618+ services indexed)
- Autonomous agent demo details

### Questions You Might Get:

**Q: "Why won't Coinbase build this themselves?"**
A: "They're focused on protocol infrastructure, not application-layer trust. They need neutral third parties to rate services - just like Visa doesn't rate merchants. We're already collaborating with them through our PR and data sharing."

**Q: "What if fraud is low in x402?"**
A: "Our analysis shows 40-50% of current activity shows manipulation signals - wash trading, fake volume, services gaming metrics. But even if fraud were low, agents still need quality ratings. Which API is faster? More reliable? Better priced? That's our core value."

**Q: "Can't agents just check on-chain data themselves?"**
A: "They can see transaction volume. They can't see uptime, response times, whether services actually deliver quality results, or fraud patterns. That requires continuous monitoring, interpretation, and methodology refinement - that's our moat."

**Q: "How do you compete with OpenRouter?"**
A: "OpenRouter is API aggregation for humans with credit cards. We're trust infrastructure for AI agents with crypto wallets. Different customers, different use case. Also, we're 0% markup in beta vs their 5%."

**Q: "Why is the AI Gateway not venture-scale?"**
A: "AI proxy margins are commoditizing. The Gateway is strategic - it proves we deliver, builds credibility, and generates cash flow. Trust Routing is where we scale. That 5% fee on routed volume is paying for confidence in a irreversible payment system."
