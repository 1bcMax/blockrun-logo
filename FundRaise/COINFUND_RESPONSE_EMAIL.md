## Email Response

**Subject:** Re: BlockRun Introduction

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! Really excited to connect - CoinFund's portfolio at the AI + crypto intersection (Worldcoin, Prime Intellect, Catena Labs) is exactly the space we're playing in.

Yes, we're raising our seed round now ($2M at $20M post) and would love to chat. Your check size and thesis fit perfectly - we're looking for a lead or co-lead partner.

Quick context:
• **Live product:** AI Gateway on Base (31+ models via x402 USDC micropayments)
• **Media traction:** State of x402 research featured by @Bankless this week
• **Former Circle:** 3 years Head of Data Science, built USDC data infrastructure
• **Solana expansion:** Q1 2026 based on strong ecosystem demand
• **Portfolio synergy:** Already connected with Sean Neville at Catena Labs

We have strong interest from Electric Capital (follow-up stage with Ren) and the Solana ecosystem, so timing matters.

**Available this week:**
• Thursday 2-4pm PT
• Friday 10am-12pm PT
• Friday 2-5pm PT

Does any of these work for a 20-30 min intro call?

Best,
Vicky

## Alternative: Shorter Version (if you prefer ultra-concise)

**Subject:** Re: BlockRun Introduction

Hi [Name],

Perfect timing - we're raising $2M seed now ($20M post) and CoinFund is exactly the partner we're looking for.

Context:
• Live AI Gateway on Base (31+ models, x402 USDC payments)
• Former Circle Head of Data Science (3 years)
• Expanding to Solana Q1 2026
• Sean Neville (Catena Labs) connection

Electric Capital and Solana ecosystem actively interested. Let's chat this week?

Available: Thu 2-4pm, Fri 10am-12pm, Fri 2-5pm PT

Best,
Vicky

## Alternative: Most Direct (founder-to-founder tone)

**Subject:** Re: BlockRun Introduction

Hey [Name],

Great timing. Raising $2M seed, looking for lead/co-lead.

We're live on Base with AI payment infrastructure (x402/USDC). Former Circle, building the trust layer for AI agents. Expanding to Solana Q1.

You know Sean Neville at Catena - he's looking at us too. Electric Capital in follow-up stage with Ren.

Free this week for 30 min?

Vicky

## Key Strategy Points

### Why This Works:

1. **Directness**: No "happy to discuss fit for this round OR seed later" - you're raising $2M, they should join now
2. **Competitive Tension**: Mention Electric Capital + Solana ecosystem interest
3. **Portfolio Synergy**: Sean Neville connection (their portfolio company)
4. **Urgency**: "Timing matters" + specific availability this week
5. **Confidence**: Not asking "do you want to participate?" but "when can we talk?"

### What NOT to Say:

❌ "I know CoinFund typically does larger checks" - they do $1M-$10M, $2M is PERFECT
❌ "Would love to stay connected for future rounds" - they should join NOW
❌ "If it's a fit" - assume it's a fit, they reached out inbound
❌ Any hedging or uncertainty - you're choosing partners, not begging

### Talking Points for the Call:

**Opening (First 2 minutes):**
- Live product on Base mainnet (proof of execution)
- Former Circle background (payments DNA)
- x402 infrastructure play (not consumer app risk)
- $600M+ x402 volume in 2025

**Why Now (Minute 3-5):**
- First-mover data advantage (collecting all x402 transaction data daily)
- Competitor in 2027 can raise more money but can't buy 18 months of data
- x402 v2 launched Dec 11, 2025 - we're live already

**The Ask (Minute 5-7):**
- $2M seed at $20M post
- Looking for lead ($1M+) or co-lead ($750K-1M)
- Electric Capital in diligence (Ren follow-up stage)
- Close by end of Feb 2026

**Portfolio Fit (Minute 7-10):**
- Catena Labs (Sean Neville) - AI agent payments thesis
- Prime Intellect - AI infrastructure
- Worldcoin - identity/payments for AI
- BlockRun sits at intersection of all three

**Traction (If Asked):**
- Live on Base mainnet
- 31+ AI models integrated
- Contributing to x402 core (PR merged, feature requests open)
- Partnerships: AgentKit (Coinbase), GOAT SDK, nofx
- Expanding to Solana Q1 (ecosystem demand)

**Differentiation:**
1. First-mover data moat (collecting trust data NOW)
2. Technical expertise (Circle payments + fraud detection)
3. Ecosystem position (integrated with x402 foundation)

**Timeline:**
- Intro call: This week (Jan 9-10)
- Deep dive: Next week (Jan 13-17)
- Diligence: Jan 20-31
- Term sheet: Early Feb
- Close: End of Feb

## Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response)

**If no response by Jan 9 EOD:**
```
Quick bump - still available Thu/Fri this week.

CoinFund's AI + crypto portfolio (especially Catena Labs)
makes this a natural fit. Worth 30 min?

- Vicky
```

**If no response by Jan 10:**
```
[Name] - would love to connect before we close this round.

We have strong interest from Electric Capital and Solana
ecosystem, but CoinFund's thesis fit + check size makes you
our preferred lead.

Any time next week work?
```

## After the Call

**If Positive:**
1. Send deck + data room link same day
2. Intro to co-founder Mike
3. Schedule deep dive technical session
4. Ask about their diligence process and timeline
5. Get intro to their portfolio companies (Catena Labs, Prime Intellect)

**If Neutral:**
1. Ask what concerns they have
2. Address objections in follow-up email
3. Send traction updates weekly
4. Keep warm for Series A

**If Negative:**
1. Ask for specific feedback
2. Request intro to other investors they think are better fit
3. Add to quarterly update list
4. Move on quickly to Pantera/others

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Version 1 (balanced tone) or Version 2 (concise)**

Version 3 is very direct and works well if you already have strong momentum/multiple term sheets, but might be too aggressive for first outreach.
