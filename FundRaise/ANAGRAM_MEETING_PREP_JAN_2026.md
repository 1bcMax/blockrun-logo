## About Anagram

### Firm Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2021 |
| **Founders** | Joey Krug (Augur, Pantera), Crystal Rose (Placeholder) |
| **Thesis** | Early-stage crypto infrastructure + consumer applications |
| **Check Size** | $500K-$2M seed stage |
| **Sweet Spot** | Infrastructure with network effects |
| **Geographic Focus** | Global, strong in US + Solana ecosystem |

### Notable Portfolio

| Company | Category | Why Relevant |

| **Worldcoin** | Identity | AI + crypto convergence |
| **Polymarket** | Prediction markets | Real-time payments, agent trading |

### Investment Thesis Match

**What They Love:**
1. **Infrastructure with network effects** - BlockRun = Plaid for x402
2. **Early protocol adoption** - x402 just launched, we're first mover
3. **Consumer + developer** - AI Gateway is both (like Farcaster)
4. **Solana ecosystem** - expanding Q1, ecosystem bet
5. **AI + crypto convergence** - Worldcoin thesis overlap

**BlockRun Thesis Fit:** 95/100 - Nearly perfect alignment

---

## Why BlockRun for Anagram

### 1. Solana Expansion = Ecosystem Bet

**Their Interest:**
- Lily Liu (Solana Foundation) vouched for us
- Solana needs AI agent infrastructure
- BlockRun brings x402 to Solana ecosystem

**Our Angle:**
```
"We're live on Base with 31+ AI models. Solana community has been
asking for us - we're expanding Q1 2026. This is an ecosystem
infrastructure play, not just another app."
```

**Proof Points:**
- Lily Liu endorsement
- State of x402 research featured by @Bankless this week (100K+ crypto audience)
- Solana developer demand (quantify if possible)
- Partnership discussions with Solana ecosystem projects
- Technical roadmap for Solana integration

### 2. Consumer Infrastructure (Like Farcaster)

**Their Portfolio Theme:**
- Farcaster = decentralized social with network effects
- Zora = creator economy infrastructure
- BlockRun = AI agent economy infrastructure

**Our Angle:**
```
"Just like Farcaster created infrastructure for decentralized social,
we're creating infrastructure for the AI agent economy. It's consumer-
facing (AI Gateway) but infrastructure-level (trust layer)."
```

**Network Effects:**
- More AI agents using BlockRun = more transaction data
- More data = better trust scoring
- Better trust = more agents join
- Flywheel effect (like Farcaster's social graph)

### 3. Polymarket Synergy

**Portfolio Overlap:**
- Anagram invested in Polymarket
- We're integrating with Polymarket agents (GitHub PR #124)
- Autonomous trading agents need trust infrastructure

**Our Angle:**
```
"We're already integrating with Polymarket - their autonomous trading
agents will use our trust layer for safe, verified payments. This is
portfolio synergy."
```

### 4. AI + Crypto Convergence (Worldcoin Theme)

**Their Thesis:**
- Worldcoin = identity for AI
- BlockRun = payments for AI
- Complementary infrastructure

**Our Angle:**
```
"Worldcoin is identity for AI, we're payments. As AI agents become
autonomous economic actors, they need both - identity AND trusted
payment rails."
```

## Opening Hook (First 60 Seconds)

### Option 1: Solana-Forward

"Thanks for taking the time - and thanks to Lily for the intro. I'm building the trust layer for AI agent payments on x402, and we're bringing it to Solana in Q1.

We're live on Base today with an AI Gateway - 31 models, USDC micropayments, one line of code. But the real business is the trust infrastructure: reputation scores, discovery, fraud prevention for the 700+ x402 services coming online.

Lily connected us because Solana's going to be a huge part of this - the community's asking for it, and we're building it. This is an infrastructure play on the AI agent economy, and we're first."

### Option 2: Portfolio-Forward

"Thanks for the intro through Lily. I saw your portfolio - Farcaster, Polymarket, Worldcoin - and BlockRun fits right in.

We're building consumer infrastructure for AI agents. Just like Farcaster did for social, we're doing it for payments. Live product on Base, expanding to Solana Q1, and we're already integrating with Polymarket agents.

It's infrastructure with network effects - more agents, more data, better trust scores. And we're first to market on x402."

### Option 3: Problem-First

"AI agents can pay for things now with x402 and USDC. The problem? They don't know who to trust. No reviews, no reputation, no refunds.

We're building that trust layer. Live on Base, expanding to Solana Q1. Think Plaid for x402 - verification infrastructure that sits between agents and services.

Lily connected us because Solana's a big part of our roadmap, and we're raising $2M to accelerate that."

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Option 1 (Solana-Forward) - Lily intro + Solana expansion is your strongest angle**

---

## Pitch Structure (20-25 Minutes)

### Minute 0-2: Hook + Context
- Thank Lily for intro
- Solana expansion Q1
- Infrastructure for AI agent economy

### Minute 2-5: The Problem
- x402 launched Sept 2025 ($600M+ volume)
- AI agents can pay, but can't trust
- No reviews, no reputation, irreversible payments
- **Show pain point:** "How does Claude know if it should pay API X or API Y?"

### Minute 5-8: The Solution
- **Phase 1 (Live):** AI Gateway (proof we ship)
- **Phase 2 (2026):** Trust Layer for all x402
- **Phase 3 (2027):** Discovery + routing for 700+ services

**Demo:** Show live AI Gateway transaction on Base

### Minute 8-12: Why This Works
- **Infrastructure moat:** First-mover data advantage
- **Network effects:** Like Farcaster's social graph, but for trust
- **Timing:** x402 v2 just launched, we're live already
- **Team:** Former Circle Data Science Head (payments + fraud expertise)

### Minute 12-15: Traction + Roadmap
- Live on Base mainnet
- 31+ AI models integrated
- **Media:** State of x402 featured by @Bankless this week (100K+ audience)
- Partnerships: AgentKit, GOAT SDK, nofx, Polymarket
- Contributing to x402 core (PR merged)
- **Solana Q1:** Community demand + ecosystem fit

### Minute 15-18: The Ask
- Raising $2M seed at $20M post
- Looking for lead ($1M) or co-lead ($500K-750K)
- Anagram perfect fit: Solana ecosystem + consumer infra thesis
- Strong interest from CoinFund (inbound), Electric Capital (follow-up)
- Timeline: Close by end of Feb

### Minute 18-22: Q&A
- Let them ask questions
- Listen for concerns
- Address objections

### Minute 22-25: Next Steps
- What's your process? (qualify their timeline)
- When can we do deep dive? (push for this week)
- What other info do you need? (remove friction)
- **Ask for decision timeline**

## Key Talking Points

### 1. Solana Expansion (PRIMARY ANGLE)

**Setup:**
"Lily connected us because Solana's a critical part of our roadmap. We're live on Base, but the Solana community has been asking for us - and we're delivering Q1."

**Why Solana Matters:**
- High-performance chain for AI agent transactions
- Strong developer community
- Lily Liu / Solana Foundation support
- Ecosystem of AI/crypto projects to integrate with
- Lower transaction costs for micropayments

**Proof:**
- Lily's endorsement (she doesn't intro everyone)
- Developer demand (quantify if possible)
- Technical roadmap ready
- Q1 2026 launch target

### 2. Portfolio Synergy

**Farcaster Parallel:**
"You invested in Farcaster because it was consumer-facing infrastructure with network effects. BlockRun is the same for AI agents - it's an API/gateway (consumer), but the trust layer is infrastructure-level."

**Polymarket Integration:**
"We're already integrating with Polymarket (GitHub PR #124). Your portfolio company's trading agents will use our trust infrastructure for verified payments. This creates portfolio synergy."

**Worldcoin Complementary:**
"Worldcoin is identity for AI, we're payments. They're solving 'is this a real person?' - we're solving 'can this agent be trusted to pay/receive?' Complementary infrastructure."

### 3. First-Mover Data Moat

**The Moat:**
"Every day we're live, we're collecting transaction data across all x402 services. Uptime, response times, payment patterns, fraud signals. A competitor starting in 2027 can raise more money than us - but they can't buy 18 months of verified data."

**Why It Matters:**
- Trust = data-driven (like credit scores)
- Historical data = predictive accuracy
- Cold start problem for competitors
- Network effects compound over time

### 4. Infrastructure, Not App Risk

**The Pitch:**
"This isn't a consumer app that depends on viral growth. It's infrastructure - every AI agent that uses x402 needs trust verification. We're building the Plaid of x402."

**Why Investors Care:**
- Infrastructure = B2B revenue model
- Less marketing risk (developers discover via integrations)
- Stickier (switching costs once integrated)
- Higher margins than consumer apps

### 5. Team = Payments DNA

**Background:**
- 3 years Circle (Head of Data Science, built USDC data infra)
- Director DS at Capital One (anti-fraud AI)
- Azure ML Tech Lead at Microsoft
- This is **exact intersection** of career: trust infrastructure for payments

**Why It Matters:**
"I've built trust systems for payments at $100B+ scale (Circle, Capital One). I know how fraud detection works, how to score risk, how to build compliance into infrastructure. This isn't my first rodeo."

---

## Competitive Tension (Use Strategically)

### Don't Lead With It, But Have It Ready

**If They Ask About Timeline:**
"We're moving fast. CoinFund reached out inbound last week, Electric Capital is in follow-up stage with Ren, and we have strong Solana ecosystem interest through Lily. We want the right partners, not just the fastest money - but we're closing this round by end of Feb."

**If They Ask About Other Investors:**
"We're talking to CoinFund (Catena Labs synergy), Electric Capital (Ren met with us), Pantera (could lead), and several Solana ecosystem investors. You're our preferred partner because of the Solana ecosystem fit and your consumer infrastructure thesis."

**If They Hesitate:**
"We'd love Anagram to lead or co-lead. Your portfolio (Farcaster, Polymarket) and Solana ecosystem position make you our top choice. What would you need to see to get to yes?"

---

## Questions to Ask Them

### Qualification Questions (Early)

1. **"What attracted you to BlockRun specifically?"**
   - Understand their thesis angle
   - Tailor rest of pitch to their interest

2. **"How do you see Solana's role in the AI agent economy?"**
   - Test their conviction on Solana
   - Align your vision with theirs

3. **"What's your typical check size for seed rounds?"**
   - Qualify: Can they do $500K-$1M?
   - Understand if they're lead material

### Process Questions (Middle)

4. **"What's your diligence process look like?"**
   - Timeline: Days? Weeks?
   - What do they need: References? Tech deep-dive?

5. **"How do you typically work with portfolio companies?"**
   - Value-add expectations
   - Hands-on vs. hands-off

6. **"Any concerns we should address now?"**
   - Surface objections early
   - Address in real-time

### Next Steps Questions (End)

7. **"What's the best next step from your side?"**
   - Let them dictate process
   - But push for specific timeline

8. **"When do you think you'll have a decision?"**
   - Hard timeline question
   - Qualify serious vs. tire-kicking

9. **"Can you intro us to portfolio companies for partnerships?"**
   - Farcaster, Polymarket, Zora integrations
   - Show you're thinking ecosystem, not just capital

---

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "x402 adoption is uncertain"

**Response:**
"Fair concern. But x402 hit $600M volume in first 2 months (Nov 2025). Coinbase, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, AWS, Anthropic are already integrated. Even if it's 10% of what we think, that's still a $10B+ market - and we're first-mover on trust infrastructure.

Plus, our AI Gateway is live today - we're not dependent on future adoption. We're building the trust layer as the market grows."

### Objection 2: "Why can't agents just use reputation from Web2?"

**Response:**
"They could, but Web2 reputation doesn't work for blockchain-native payments. You need on-chain verification, real-time fraud detection, and cross-chain trust scoring. Plus, x402 is new - there's no existing reputation system. We're building it from scratch, which is our first-mover advantage."

### Objection 3: "Too early stage - come back for Series A"

**Response:**
"We're live on Base today, not a pitch deck. We have traction, partnerships (AgentKit, GOAT, nofx), and PRs merged into x402 core. If you wait for Series A, you'll pay 3-5x valuation and we'll already have the data moat. The opportunity is now."

### Objection 4: "Why not just integrate with existing services like Stripe?"

**Response:**
"Stripe doesn't do blockchain-native payments, and they don't understand AI agent trust. x402 is USDC micropayments over HTTP - it's a completely new payment primitive. We're building Stripe-level trust infrastructure for this new standard."

### Objection 5: "What if larger players (Coinbase, Circle) build this?"

**Response:**
"They could, but they're focused on payment rails, not trust/reputation. Circle makes money when anyone uses USDC - they're Switzerland. They want someone like us to exist because it makes x402 safer and drives adoption. That's why my former colleagues at Circle are supportive.

Plus, trust is winner-take-most. First to market with data wins."

### Objection 6: "Solana is Q1 - why should I invest now?"

**Response:**
"Because the fundraise closes in Feb, and Solana launch is in March. You're getting in before the ecosystem expansion. Plus, our Base product is already generating data we'll use on Solana - you're investing in the data advantage, not just future launches."
