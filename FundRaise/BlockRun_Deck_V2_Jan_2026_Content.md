The Trust Layer for AI Agent Payments

Building FICO for the Agent Economy
```

### Speaker Notes
"Hi, I'm Vicky Fu, founder of BlockRun. We're building the trust infrastructure for the agent economy - think FICO for AI agents. Over the next 10 minutes, I'll show you why this is a massive opportunity, why we're uniquely positioned to win, and why the next 6-12 months will determine the market leader."

## SLIDE 2: THE AGENT ECONOMY IS HERE

### Visual
**Main Diagram:**
```

    ↓ manages
[10 Agent Icons in a row]
    ↓ each agent pays
[100 Service Icons (grid pattern)]

Total: 1 human → 10 agents → 1,000 transactions
```

**Supporting Data (bottom corner):**
- x402 Protocol: $600M volume in 2 months
- 20+ hackathon projects in 3 weeks
- Scale AI RLI: Agents now do freelance work

### Content
```
AI agents just became economic actors.

From AI-as-a-Tool → AI-as-Economic-Entity

Agents now:
• Manage their own wallets
• Pay for services they need
• Earn revenue autonomously
• Make financial decisions without human intervention

Humans will manage 10x, 100x, 1000x agents.
Each agent needs to know who to trust before it pays.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Scale AI RLI: Agents automate 2.5% of freelance work today.
The path to 25%, 50%, 100% is trust infrastructure.
```

### Key Statistics
- **x402 Protocol Volume:** $600M in first 2 months (Nov-Dec 2025)
- **Hackathon Proof:** 20+ projects launched in 3 weeks (Jan 2026)
- **Scale AI RLI Benchmark:** 240 real-world projects, 2.5% automation rate (we're at the BEGINNING)

### Speaker Notes
"The agent economy isn't coming - it's here. AI agents just became autonomous economic actors with their own wallets, making payments without human intervention.

But here's the critical insight: Scale AI's RLI Benchmark tested 240 real-world freelance projects across 23 categories - everything from data analysis to graphic design to copywriting. Current AI agents can only automate 2.5% of that work. We're at the BEGINNING of the agent economy curve.

The path from 2.5% to 25%, 50%, eventually 100% automation represents massive growth. And before that scaling happens, trust infrastructure needs to be in place. That's what we're building.

If you're managing 100 agents and each agent makes 10 payments per day, that's 1,000 autonomous transactions. How do you know which services are safe? How does your agent know which provider to trust before it pays?

x402 hit $600M in volume in just 2 months. The January 2026 hackathon proved demand with 20+ projects. This is real, and we're early."

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM - AGENTS CAN'T TRUST YET

### Visual
**Main Illustration:**

```

### Content
```
How does an AI agent know which service to trust before paying?

The Problem:
❌ x402 payments are FINAL (no refunds, no chargebacks, no customer service)
❌ 700+ services coming online with ZERO reputation system
❌ Agents can't evaluate trust signals like humans do
❌ Every payment is a risk without verified trust data

Once an agent pays, the payment is final.
```

### Real-World Example
"Your trading agent wants to buy market data. There are 12 providers offering the same API. Which one delivers accurate data? Which one will actually respond when called? Which one won't disappear with your money?

Your agent can't tell. There's no Yelp for x402 services. There's no Better Business Bureau. There's no credit score. BlockRun provides that."

### Speaker Notes
"This is the core problem. x402 payments are crypto-native and irreversible. Once your agent sends USDC, it's gone. No refunds, no chargebacks, no customer service to call.

700+ services are coming online right now with zero reputation history. An agent has no way to evaluate trust before paying. That's what we solve."

## SLIDE 4: EVERY PAYMENT SYSTEM NEEDS TRUST FIRST

### Visual
**Table Format:**

| Era  | Payment System      | Trust Layer           | Time to Scale |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 1958 | Consumer credit     | **FICO**              | 30 years      |
| 1994 | E-commerce          | **SSL/Verisign**      | 10 years      |
| 2007 | Mobile payments     | **Device fingerprint**| 5 years       |
| 2026 | AI agent payments   | **? (BlockRun)**      | —             |

**Timeline indicator at bottom:**
```
← Slower adoption          Faster adoption →

Trust infrastructure determines who wins.
```

### Content
```
Every Payment System Required Trust Infrastructure Before It Could Scale

FICO enabled consumer credit to scale (30 years to become default)
SSL/Verisign enabled e-commerce to scale (10 years)
Device fingerprinting enabled mobile payments to scale (5 years)

x402 launched September 2025.
The trust infrastructure winner will be determined in 6-12 months.
```

### Speaker Notes
"This isn't new. Every payment system in history required trust infrastructure before it could scale.

FICO launched in 1958 - it took 30 years to become the default credit scoring system. SSL and Verisign launched in 1994 - it took 10 years for e-commerce to really take off. Device fingerprinting for mobile payments in 2007 - it took 5 years.

The pattern is clear: trust infrastructure comes BEFORE mass adoption. And each cycle is getting faster.

x402 launched in September 2025. That's 4 months ago. The agent economy is moving faster than any previous payment revolution. The first 6-12 months will determine the market leader. That's why timing matters so much."

BlockRun: The Phased Approach to Building Trust

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 1 (Live Now): AI Gateway
• 31 LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
• Pay-per-use with USDC, no API keys
• One line of code. Wallet = identity.
• Proves we deliver. Generates cash flow.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 2 (Q1 2026): Trust Layer for All x402
• Reputation ratings for 700+ services
• Discovery across 618+ indexed services
• Verification: uptime, response times, fraud detection

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Start with AI. Expand to everything.
```

### Tagline (Bottom)
```
AI Gateway = wedge (proves we deliver)
Trust Routing = the business (where we scale)
```

### Speaker Notes
"We're taking a phased approach that de-risks execution while building competitive moats.

Phase 1 is our AI Gateway - it's live on Base mainnet right now. 31 AI models, pay-per-use with USDC, no API keys needed. One line of code and your agent can access GPT-4, Claude, Gemini. This proves we can deliver, generates cash flow, and gets us real transaction data.

Phase 2 is the trust layer for ALL x402 services - reputation ratings, discovery, verification. This is where we scale. This is the $100M+ revenue business.

The AI Gateway is the wedge. Trust routing is the business. We start narrow, prove execution, then expand to the entire x402 ecosystem."

We Are Building the Layer Every x402 Application Needs

BlockRun sits BETWEEN applications and protocol.

Every x402 app needs trust verification.
Every agent needs to know who to trust before paying.
Every service wants verified reputation.

Applications come and go.
Infrastructure compounds.
```

### Key Points
- **Position:** Middleware between apps and protocol
- **Durability:** Infrastructure outlasts individual applications
- **Network Effects:** More agents → more data → better trust scores → more agents

### Speaker Notes
"This diagram shows where we sit in the stack. Applications like trading bots and research agents sit at the top. The protocol - x402, USDC, Base - sits at the bottom. We're the trust layer in the middle.

Every x402 application needs trust verification. Every agent needs to know who to trust. Every service wants a verified reputation. We provide that layer.

This is crucial: applications come and go. Infrastructure compounds. We're not building a trading bot or a specific agent. We're building the trust infrastructure that every agent and every application needs."

Our Moat is Interpretation, Not Information.

A competitor starting in Q3 2026 can see the same blockchain data.

They CANNOT replicate 8+ months of:
• Uptime measurements
• Latency distributions
• Calibrated fraud signals
• Service behavior patterns

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is like FICO.
Trust = data-driven.
Early data wins.
```

### Speaker Notes
"Here's why we have a defensible moat. A competitor can raise $50M in 2027, hire a great team, and see all the same blockchain data we see. But they can't replicate 8 months of verified historical measurements.

Trust scoring is like credit scoring. FICO works because they have decades of payment history. We're building the same thing for agents - verified uptime data, latency distributions, calibrated fraud signals, service behavior patterns.

This data compounds. Our scoring algorithms get refined through thousands of edge cases. We get embedded in developer workflows through SDK integrations. Services want our verification badge. Agents learn to trust our scores.

A competitor starting in 2027 can't buy this. They have to earn it over time. That's our moat."

Distribution is Built-In Through Partner Integrations

Initial Distribution Channels:
• Coinbase AgentKit → 10K+ agent developers
• GOAT SDK → 150K downloads
• nofx AI Trading Agent OS → 10K GitHub stars

Every integration = distribution.
Every agent using our trust scores = more transaction data.
More data = better scores.
Better scores = more agents join.

Network effects.

10 more partner integrations on the roadmap.
```

### Speaker Notes
"We don't need to acquire users through traditional marketing. Distribution is built into our go-to-market strategy through SDK integrations.

Coinbase AgentKit reaches 10,000+ agent developers. GOAT SDK has 150,000 downloads. nofx has 10,000 GitHub stars. When we integrate with these frameworks, we instantly reach thousands of developers building agents.

And here's the network effect: every agent using our trust scores generates more transaction data. More data means better trust scores. Better scores attract more agents. This compounds.

We have 10 more partner integrations on the roadmap. Each one brings distribution at near-zero customer acquisition cost."

Proof: A Live Autonomous Agent Using Our Infrastructure

We built a fully autonomous agent that proves the thesis:

✓ Manages its own wallet with USDC on Polygon
✓ Uses the BlockRun AI Gateway to analyze markets via GPT, Claude, and Gemini
✓ Places real trades with real money, completely autonomously
✓ Runs 24/7

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The product is live.
Users are asking for more chains.
```

### Speaker Notes
"Let me show you proof that this works. We built a fully autonomous Polymarket trading agent that uses our infrastructure.

This agent manages its own wallet with USDC. It uses the BlockRun AI Gateway to analyze markets using multiple AI models - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini. It makes trading decisions and places real bets with real money. It runs 24/7 without any human intervention.

This isn't a pitch deck concept. This is a live autonomous agent trading right now on Polymarket using BlockRun infrastructure.

And here's the validation: users are already asking for more chains. They want Solana support. They want Arbitrum. The demand is real."

Solo Founder Building at 10x Speed

Vicky Fu, Founder
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I consume 2 BILLION tokens per month building BlockRun.
That's $20K-$40K in AI usage every month as a solo founder.

What that means:
• I AM the agent economy power user
• I understand the economics of AI consumption at scale
• I'm building the infrastructure I need myself
• I use AI agents to 10x my productivity

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Scale AI RLI Benchmark (240 real-world projects):
Current AI agents automate only 2.5% of freelance work.

I'm not building for 2.5%.
I'm living in the future where that's 25%, 50%, 100%.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Background:
⚪ Circle – Head of Data Science. Built data infrastructure for USDC.
🔵 Capital One – Director, Data Science. Led anti-fraud AI at $100B+ scale.
🟦 Microsoft – Azure ML Tech Lead.

This is the exact intersection of my entire career:
Trust infrastructure + Payments + Fraud detection + AI
```

### Speaker Notes
"Let me tell you the solo founder story - because it's the ultimate founder-market fit.

I consume 2 BILLION tokens per month building BlockRun. That's $20,000 to $40,000 in AI usage every single month as a solo founder. Most founders pitch a vision they imagine. I'm pitching infrastructure I'm already building and using.

Here's the context: Scale AI just released their RLI Benchmark - they tested 240 real-world freelance projects worth $144,000 in total value. Projects like data analysis, graphic design, copywriting, web development. They measured how much work AI agents can actually automate today.

The answer? 2.5%.

That's the baseline. Current AI agents can automate 2.5% of remote freelance work. I'm not building for that 2.5%. I'm operating at a scale that's 10x, 20x beyond what that benchmark shows is possible today. I'm living in the future where AI agents automate 25%, 50%, eventually 100% of that work.

I understand the economics of AI consumption at scale because I live it every day. I use AI agents to 10x my productivity. I AM the agent economy power user. I'm the customer, the builder, and the proof.

And here's why I'm uniquely positioned: I spent 3 years as Head of Data Science at Circle building data infrastructure for USDC. Before that, I was Director of Data Science at Capital One leading anti-fraud AI at $100 billion scale. Before that, Azure ML Tech Lead at Microsoft.

This is the exact intersection of my entire career: trust infrastructure, payments, fraud detection, and AI. Everything I've built led to this moment."

A Simple Model: Capture a Small Fee on Massive Volume

Revenue Streams:
• AI Gateway: 5% markup (proves delivery, generates cash)
• Trust Routing: 5% of routed volume (where we scale)

At scale (100M monthly transactions):
→ $500K - $1M Monthly Recurring Revenue

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

No enterprise sales.
No customer acquisition cost.
Agents use our trust scores → we capture percentage of routed volume.
```

### Speaker Notes
"The business model is beautifully simple: capture a small fee on massive volume.

We have two revenue streams. The AI Gateway charges a 5% markup on AI model usage - this proves we deliver and generates early cash flow. Trust Routing charges 5% of transaction volume we route through trusted services - this is where we scale.

At 100 million monthly transactions, we're at $500K to $1M in monthly recurring revenue. And we can get there with zero enterprise sales team and near-zero customer acquisition cost.

Here's why: agents automatically use our trust scores when making payment decisions. We don't need to convince enterprises to buy. We don't need a sales team. We just need agents to adopt our infrastructure, and we capture a percentage of the value we create."

Why Now: Four Trends Converging

1️⃣ AI Agents went from research → production (2024-2025)
   Claude, GPT-4, Gemini all support tool use + reasoning

2️⃣ Stablecoins hit regulatory clarity (2025)
   Circle, Coinbase backing = institutional legitimacy

3️⃣ Payment protocols matured (x402 launched Sept 2025)
   $600M volume in 2 months = product-market fit

4️⃣ Empirical validation (Scale AI RLI, Jan 2026)
   240 real projects, $144K value tested = agents are real economic actors
   2.5% baseline today → 25%+ automation coming = massive growth ahead

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All four had to happen.
Now they have.

x402 is 4 months old.
We're at 2.5% automation. The path to 25%+ needs trust infrastructure.
The winner will be determined in the next 6-12 months.

This is the moment.
```

### Speaker Notes
"Why now? Because four critical trends are converging simultaneously for the first time.

First, AI agents went from research projects to production systems. Claude, GPT-4, Gemini all support tool use and reasoning. Agents can actually do work now.

Second, stablecoins hit regulatory clarity. Circle and Coinbase backing means institutional legitimacy. USDC is production-ready infrastructure.

Third, payment protocols matured. x402 launched in September 2025 and hit $600M volume in 2 months. That's clear product-market fit.

Fourth - and this is new - we now have empirical validation. Scale AI just released their RLI Benchmark testing 240 real-world freelance projects worth $144,000. They measured exactly how much work AI agents can automate today across data analysis, design, writing, development.

The answer is 2.5%. That's not a problem - that's the opportunity. We're at the beginning of the curve. The path from 2.5% to 25%, 50%, eventually 100% represents MASSIVE growth. And before that scaling happens, trust infrastructure needs to be in place.

All four had to happen before the agent economy could scale. Now they have.

x402 is only 4 months old. We're at 2.5% automation. The trust infrastructure winner will be determined in the next 6-12 months. That's why timing is everything. This is the moment."

└────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Key Milestones:

Q2 2026: Trust Ratings beta, AgentKit integration live
Q4 2026: $10K MRR, Solana support, 10+ SDK integrations
Q2 2027: $50K MRR, multi-chain live
Q4 2027: $100K MRR, 100K daily transactions
```

### Speaker Notes
"We're raising a $2M seed round to become the default trust layer for x402.

Use of funds breaks down to 40% engineering, 30% integrations, 30% operations.

40% engineering gets us a senior infrastructure engineer and an ML engineer to accelerate the Trust Ratings product. This is core to our competitive moat.

30% for integrations funds SDK partnerships, the AgentKit launch, and multi-chain expansion. This is our distribution strategy.

30% for operations covers infrastructure costs, go-to-market, and community building.

This gives us a 24-month runway to hit $100K MRR and 100,000 daily transactions. We'll be in a strong position to raise a Series A at that point, or continue growing on revenue if the market shifts."

```

### Speaker Notes
"To close: this isn't an incremental improvement on existing infrastructure. This is a new economic category being born.

We're at the beginning of the agent economy. There will be millions, then billions of AI agents making autonomous financial decisions. Every single one needs to know who to trust before it pays.

BlockRun is building the trust infrastructure for that future. We're live, we're executing, we have ecosystem validation, and we have the exact right founder with the exact right background at the exact right time.

The next 6-12 months will determine who wins this category. We're already 4 months ahead.

Let's build the trust layer for the agent economy together.

Thank you."
